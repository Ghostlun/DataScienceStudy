Despite the scientific evidence communicated, the public remains reluctant to take preventive measures against global warming. The aim of the paper is to investigate the communicative actions of publics proposed as in the situational theory of problem solving to understand publics' communicative actions towards global warming. The paper utilizes a fuzzy rule-based system approach to analyze the communicative actions of publics to reveal non-linear relationships; whereas previous studies mostly used linear statistical analysis. The paper provides a deeper understanding into the interplay between problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement in shaping information behavior. The results show that the communicative actions of the publics are at a low-to-moderate level. The paper's interesting finding is the nonlinear effects of constraint recognition on communicative action about global warming. Contrary to the current literature, it was found out that the dominant factor that may convince public to start taking action towards global warming seems to be recognizing being constrained at a moderate level. Based on the results, it is suggested for policy makers and communication strategists to mitigate the negative outcomes of global warming by integrating environmental issues into education at all levels and collaborating with non-governmental organizations for national awareness campaigns which focus on increasing public problem recognition and involvement.","[Demir, Mehmet Ozer] Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat Univ, Fac Econ Adm & Social Sci, Antalya, Turkiye; [Demir, Zuhal Gok; Sumer, Fulya Erendag] Fac Commun, Publ Relat & Publ Dept, Antalya, Turkiye; [Karakaya, Cigdem] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Commun, Publ Relat & Publ Dept, Antalya, Turkiye",Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University; Akdeniz University,"Karakaya,Ç (corresponding author), Akdeniz Univ, Fac Commun, Publ Relat & Publ Dept, Antalya, Turkiye.",mehmet.demir@alanya.edu.tr; zuhalgokdemir@akdeniz.edu.tr; csatir@akdeniz.edu.tr; fulyaerendag@akdeniz.edu.tr,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,0,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,AUG 15,2024,10,15,,,,,,,e35380,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35380,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35380,,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,C0W5S,,,,,2024-08-19,WOS:001286655000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The focus is on understanding how citizens temporarily adopt the roles of war correspondents, contributing to the broader conflict narrative. Employing an inductive approach, the study integrates ethnography, phenomenology, and reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) to gain insights into how citizen journalists shape war narratives. Analysing the interview data through RTA reveals six key themes: Emerging citizen journalism practices, Community Consciousness, Challenges in media perception, Self-expression and Social cohesion, Responding to Authoritarian Falsehoods, Teen journalism, and Self-protection and safety. The findings suggest that the citizen journalism practices in Palestine and Kashmir strategically report the war narratives, representing a progressive journalism practice. The results underline that citizen journalism practices in these regions purposefully present war narratives and represent a form of constructive journalism, which responds to authoritarian regimes' extensive control over mainstream media and facilitates reconciliation and peace. Such citizen journalism practices act as an equipoise to data imbalances in information architecture for the consumers. The research underscores how conflict citizen journalism embodies activist and collaborative models with robust potential for replication in other conflict-ridden areas.","[Majeed, Tawseef] Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Design & Innovat, 2nd Floor,95 Taimoor Nagar, New Delhi 110025, India; [Abushbak, Ali M.; Sinha, Atul] Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India; [Qadri, Monisa] Islamic Univ Sci & Technol, Awantipora, India",Jamia Millia Islamia,"Majeed, T (corresponding author), Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Design & Innovat, 2nd Floor,95 Taimoor Nagar, New Delhi 110025, India.",tmajeed@jmi.ac.in,,,,,"We thank the anonymous reviewers for their encouraging feedback and valuable assistance in strengthening the article's arguments.

Guided by the cybercoping model (Kim & Lee, 2014), the study examined associations between these patients' online information behaviors (information seeking and information forwarding) and coping outcomes (health problems and affective states). The study further explored the mediating roles of health coping processes (problem-and emotion-focused) in the associations between these information behaviors and coping outcomes. Survey data from 687 participants were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results highlighted the significance of information forwarding in enhancing both coping processes and outcomes, while information seeking enhanced problem-focused coping and health-problem coping outcomes alone. These associations were more pronounced among U.S. adults without chronic conditions than among those with chronic illnesses.

Methods A cross-sectional study design was employed, utilizing a stratified random sampling method to survey three colleges in Jiangsu Province, China. Physical Activity Rating Scale, Physical Activity Self-efficacy Scale, and Emotional Intelligence Scale were used to measure the college student population. Regression analysis and mediation tests assessed whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between physical exercise and college students' emotion regulation abilities. A total of 5,430 valid questionnaires were collected. Results The distribution of college students' physical activities was 77.0% for low, 13.1% for medium, and 9.3% for high levels. Physical activities were significantly and positively correlated with self-efficacy and emotional management abilities (r = 0.298,0.105;P<0.01), and self-efficacy was significantly and positively correlated with emotional management abilities (r = 0.322, P<0.01). Situational motivation and subjective support under self-efficacy were 0.08 and 0.255, respectively, and the adjusted R-2 was 0.107. Self-efficacy played a fully mediating role between physical activities and emotional management abilities, with a total effect value of 0.032. The values of the direct and indirect effects were 0.003 and 0.029, accounting for 8.95% and 90.74% of the total effect, respectively. Conclusion The physical exercise behavior of college students is primarily characterized by low intensity. Physical exercise among college students can positively predict their ability to regulate emotions. Self-efficacy fully mediates the relationship between physical exercise and emotion regulation ability among college students. College students can indirectly influence their ability to regulate emotions through physical exercise and self-efficacy.","[Mu, Fan-zheng; Liu, Jun; Lou, Hu; Zhu, Wei-dong; Li, Bo] Nantong Univ, Inst Sports Sci, Nantong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhen-cheng] Nanjing Med Univ, Sch Basic Med, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nantong University; Nanjing Medical University,"Li, B (corresponding author), Nantong Univ, Inst Sports Sci, Nantong, Peoples R China.",wangqiulibo@163.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [BLA210215]; Key Project of Jiangsu Provincial Education Science Planning [B/2022/01/173],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Key Project of Jiangsu Provincial Education Science Planning,2021 Education General Project of the 14th Five Year Plan of the National Social Science Foundation of China (BLA210215) Key Project of Jiangsu Provincial Education Science Planning (B/2022/01/173),,86,1,1,6,6,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 13,2024,19,6,,,,,,,e0303694,10.1371/journal.pone.0303694,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0303694,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,UL9Y8,38870188,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2024-08-19,WOS:001248345600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigates how individuals aware and unaware of hydrogen-related accidents perceive the risk of hydrogen refuelling facilities in Japan. The comparative analysis reveals that accident awareness significantly increases public apprehension by amplifying perceived accident probabilities and consequences. Specifically, accidentaware individuals value their subjective understanding of hydrogen knowledge more than objective knowledge when it comes to trusting hydrogen technologies. The direct impact of positive affect on alleviating risk perceptions is found to be counteracted by accident awareness. In terms of behavioural outcomes, this study confirms individuals' inclination to seek information based on their perceived risk. People are more eager to acquire risk preparedness information when they perceive the potential consequences of undesired events as significant. In contrast, the perceived likelihood of risk accidents does not exhibit such a significant relationship.

This study examines the distinct effects of trust and distrust on the public's information behaviors, specifically in the context of two food-related issues including GM food and food additives. This study employs a cross-sectional survey with 1,089 Chinese citizens. This study demonstrates that trust and motivation positively predicted information transmission behaviors (i.e., information sharing and forwarding) and information acquisition behaviors (i.e., information attending and seeking). Distrust, on the other hand, predicted only information transmission behaviors. Motivation's effects on information acquisition behaviors were moderated by trust. This study contributes to the field of health information by expanding STOPS' applicability to food-related risk contexts, conducting research with culturally distinct populations different from those featured in prior research, and distinguishing the roles of trust and distrust in influencing information behaviors.

The study also found that as individuals have greater motivation to think about GM food and food additives issues, they are more likely to attend and seek information, and such relationships vary depending on their trust levels.","[Kim, Jarim] Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Xu, Linjia] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chon, Myoung-Gi] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL USA; [Liu, Jiaying] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA USA",Yonsei University; University of International Business & Economics; Auburn University System; Auburn University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Xu, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Chinese Language & Literature, 10 Huixin Dongjie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",xulinjia@uibe.edu.cn,,"Kim, Jarim/0000-0002-2973-9656",Young Scholar Foundation of China under Young Scholar Program of National Social Science Funds [19CXW019],Young Scholar Foundation of China under Young Scholar Program of National Social Science Funds,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Young Scholar Foundation of China under Young Scholar Program of National Social Science Funds [grant number 19CXW019].",,55,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2158-2440,,,SAGE OPEN,SAGE Open,APR,2024,14,2,,,,,,,2.15824E+16,10.1177/21582440241248917,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440241248917,,,10,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,XT8J1,,gold,,,2024-08-19,WOS:001264017700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To advance research on CoO, there are calls to approach CoO from the perspectives of other disciplines. From the perspective of public relations, this study conceptualizes country-of-origin relationship (CoOR) and examines it as individuals' evaluations of a country's pursuit of a mutually beneficial relationship with their home countries. Using South Korea as an example, survey data collected from a representative sample of 514 Australian citizens found a positive association between CoOR and evaluations of the relational efforts made by multinational companies from South Korea. In response to a hypothetical event involving a South Korean company in a crisis in Australia, those who evaluated South Korean companies positively were less likely to subscribe to conspiracy theories related to the company involved, attribute responsibility to it or engage in negative megaphoning. The findings of this study suggest that CoOR, which consists of interactional bilateralism, power mutuality, relational trust, relational satisfaction and relational commitment, is critical in reducing the foreignness of a multinational company.","[Tam, Lisa] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, Brisbane, Australia; [Chon, Myoung-Gi] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, Auburn, AL USA; [Kim, Jeong-Nam] Univ Oklahoma, Gaylord Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Norman, OK USA; [Tam, Lisa] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, 2 George St, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Tam, L (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, 2 George St, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia.",l.tam@qut.edu.au,"Tam, Lisa/I-6237-2019","Tam, Lisa/0000-0001-6520-6120",,,,,107,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1553-118X,1553-1198,,INT J STRATEG COMMUN,Int.

Many people are simply fed up with the current state of affairs and want to see people in power held accountable. As a result, CEOs are taking public stances on timely issues. They are doing so not only because they want to win favor with their employees and customers but also because they feel an obligation-and pressure-to speak up and pursue greater good on behalf of others since they have platforms and visibility that are not shared by those whose lack similar status or vehicles to for their voices to be heard. This is a qualitative study that involved in-depth interviews with 24 CEO activists. Data analysis followed the hermeneutic phenomenological approach. The findings advance the CEO activism literature by focusing on the tactical repertoire of activist CEOs within the non-Western context of Ghana. Activist CEOs in Ghana use a broader portfolio of tactics than previously thought, offer a typology of CEO activism tactics, and help to internationalize CEO activism research. This study also expands upon nascent research streams such as responsible management, Africapitalism, Afrocentric philosophies of sustainability, and public relations for social responsibility.","[Adae, Eric Kwame] Drake Univ, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA; [Connolly, Daniel J.] St John Fisher Univ, Sch Business, Rochester, NY USA",Drake University; Saint John Fisher University,"Adae, EK (corresponding author), Drake Univ, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA.",eric.adae@drake.edu,,,,,,,98,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

In this essay, we review conceptions of the organization in several areas of public relations scholarship and find complexity that is unexplained by theory, causing a disconnect between public relations scholarship and practice. Using insights from stakeholder theory, essential contract theory, and intersectionality, we provide a new definition of the organization and 14 propositions about the nature of organizations. This definition is explained with a metaphor of an organization as a tent. The tent is composed of many stakeholders, each with multiple identities, utilizing contracts as poles to push and pull the organization in their preferred direction. An illustrative example is given of how this metaphor operates in a university. We call for a reorientation of public relations theory's relationships to organizations and suggest an important role for public relations and communication in constituting the nature of organizations and ensuring representativeness in decision-making.","[Page, Tyler G.] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Capizzo, Luke W.] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA",University of Connecticut; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Page, TG (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",tyler.page@uconn.edu,"Capizzo, Luke/KXT-7129-2024",,,,,,100,1,1,2,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

In contrast to numerous studies that use Situational Theory of Problem Solving (STOPS) to predict information behaviors, this study introduced and examined a streamlined model focused on predicting activism behaviors. Moreover, this study tests the Problem Chain Recognition (PCR) effect by exploring how situational motivation in problem solving related to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement affects individuals' perceptions and communicative acquisition about the issue of anti -Asian hate crimes. Further, this study examines the differences among three American socialized racial groups in terms of problem recognition, constraint recognition, involvement recognition of activism against Asian hate crimes, and activism behaviors. The results of this study revealed that situational motivation in problem solving and referent criterion lead to activism against anti -Asian hate crime. In addition, this study found positive PCR effects between BLM and ALM. This represents a pioneering utilization of the PCR effect to the field of racial activism. Importantly, there were significant differences to perceive activism for anti -Asian hate crimes among three racial group (Blacks, Whites, and Asians). Therefore, the results of this study contribute to the theoretical building of STOPS and practical implications for understanding the complexity of the American socialized racial discourse and predicting racial activism in relation to BLM and ALM.","[Chon, Myoung-Gi] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, 237 Tichenor Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Harrell, Joan R.] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, 232 H Tichenor Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Chon, MG (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, 237 Tichenor Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",mzc0113@auburn.edu; jrh0098@auburn.edu,,"Chon, Myoung-Gi/0000-0002-6586-6863",,,,,35,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

This study aims to investigate which information and sources individuals relied on in seeking COVID-19 information and further examine their roles in individuals' adoption of preventive behaviors. Methods Through a statistical analysis of 1027 valid responses from citizens in different Chinese cities in 2022 to the self-designed items in an online survey, this study identified individuals' preferred information sources and content on COVID-19. Regarding the information sources and content, the study used multiple regression analysis to examine their associations with individuals' preventive behaviors, and further applied fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore their configurations that increase the likelihood of individuals adopting preventive behaviors. Results Individuals preferred information about the newest prevention and control policies, precautions and treatment, and symptoms from the sources of workplace and community, social media, and social live streaming services. Additionally, individuals' preventive behaviors were positively related to the workplace and community (beta = 0.202, p <.001), social live streaming services (beta = 0.089, p <.01), government department websites (beta = 0.079, p <.05), television (beta = 0.073, p <.05), and online news media (beta = 0.069, p <.05), but were negatively associated with newspapers (beta=-0.087, p <.05). Regarding information content, precautions and treatments (beta = 0.211, p <.001), the newest prevention and control policies (beta = 0.173, p <.001), symptoms (beta = 0.152, p <.001), and official rumor-dispelling information (beta = 0.082, p <.05) had a positive relationship with individuals' preventive behaviors. In addition, fsQCA results presented eight configurations that promote individuals to adopt preventive behaviors. The total coverage and solution consistency values were 0.869 and 0.987, respectively. Furthermore, COVID-19 information content, the sources of social media and interpersonal sources, and official news media played an essential role in increasing the likelihood of individuals adopting preventive behaviors. Conclusions Our findings demonstrated that individuals seek various COVID-19 information from multiple sources. The direct and degree of association of information sources and content with individuals' preventive behaviors vary from source to source and from content to content.

Such offenses range from criminal acts to the public expression of controversial opinions. In response, digital activism coalesces into a socio-political force that seeks to shame, silence, or punish the offending individual. This study seeks to understand the agonistic reputational wrangle facilitated by cancel culture using an original theoretical framework that combines the rhetorical paradigm from public relations with deviance theory from sociology and media studies. Specifically, this study analyzes the cancellation and reputational repair strategies of four celebrities-Louis C.K., Logan Paul, Jussie Smollett, and J.K. Rowling. It utilizes large-scale social media sentiment analysis to reveal varying degrees of reputational decay and recovery. The study shows that factors impacting the severity of cancellation and the likelihood of reputational recovery include distinguishing between criminal acts and controversial opinions, as well as social variables and the strength of a parasocial relationship between a celebrity and their fandom.","[Hobbs, Mitchell John; O'Keefe, Sarah] Univ Sydney, Discipline Media & Commun, Sydney, Australia; [Hobbs, Mitchell John] Univ Sydney, Discipline Media & Commun, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Hobbs, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Discipline Media & Commun, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.",Mitchell.Hobbs@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,126,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

As in other sectors, the fashion industry is expected to pioneer sustainable production and consumption practices in line with the sustainability goals. Communication plays a key role in sustainable consumption practices, and the United Nations (UN) recommends that brands develop communication campaigns that will raise awareness about sustainable consumption and create a sustainable fashion movement. In this regard, the present study examines the reflections of communication activities of fashion brands regarding sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12) on the sustainability and brand perception of young consumers aged 1825 living in Istanbul. In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 participants affiliated with various universities in Istanbul using a jungmental snowball sampling method. The data were analyzed through narrative analysis based on the Situational Theory of Problem Solving (STOPS). The study results revealed that most young consumers have a high level of knowledge and interest in sustainable consumption (SC). It was determined that although they were aware of the sustainability messages of fast fashion brands (FBBs), they held varying opinions in their purchasing decisions.","[Bekil, Beyza; Genel, Zeynep] Istanbul Okan Univ, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Publ Relat & Advertising, Istanbul, Turkiye",Okan University,"Bekil, B (corresponding author), Istanbul Okan Univ, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Publ Relat & Advertising, Istanbul, Turkiye.",bebekil@stu.okan.edu.tr; zeynep.genel@okan.edu.tr,,,Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TBIdot;TAK) [1919B012200565],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TBIdot;TAK),This study was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUEB & Idot;TAK) under project number 1919B012200565.

In Study 2, we conducted an online experiment to extend the findings of Study 1 further. Study 1 revealed that employee-relevant CSR received the highest consumer behavioral engagement among all types of CSR messages. Study 2 revealed a mediation effect of consumers' engagement intention between the CSR message types and consumers' brand attitudes and trust.

In this regard, the active involvement of employees in pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) is crucial for achieving organizational environmental sustainability goals (Saeed et al., 2019). To shed light on this important issue, this study aims to investigate the impact of interacting/engaging environmental corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication strategy on employees' PEBs through the mediating effects of communal relationship and employee empowerment.Design/methodology/approachA total of 443 full-time USA employees working across various industries participated in an online survey.FindingsThe interacting/engaging environmental CSR communication strategy fosters employees' perceived communal relationship with their organizations and empowers them to support their organization's environmental initiatives, which, in turn, positively influences employees' PEBs at work.Originality/valueThis study advances CSR and internal communication literature through the lens of relationship management and self-determination theories. The findings theoretically suggest the effectiveness of the interacting/engaging environmental CSR communication strategy in nurturing favorable employee-organization relationships (EORs), employee empowerment and PEBs at work.

Communicative actions were a determining factor in individuals' willingness to follow instructions. The perception of corporate reputation influenced both communicative actions and people's willingness to follow instructions.Conclusion: The study revealed that STOPS can provide an important theoretical framework for more effective risk communication practices in public health crises such as epidemics.

An online survey conducted in Hong Kong (N = 593) and the United States (N = 625) revealed that STOPS factors play different roles in explaining active and passive information behaviors, with the referent criterion and situation motivation being the dominant factors of active and passive information behaviors, respectively. Cancer worry partly mediated the relationship between such behaviors and situational motivation. While the effect of STOPS factors can be generally replicated across Hong Kong and U.S. contexts, the effects of cancer worry cannot.

Therefore, we investigated personal factors influencing users' decisions in using and sharing COVID-19-related FCI in South Korea. The study took three steps to build hypotheses and collect data: a theoretical approach; an empirical approach through in-depth interviews; and an online survey amongst 304 information users who reside in Korea. More strictly, the interview data were analyzed through content analysis, and the online survey data were statistically analyzed using a SPSS 25.0 program. In conclusion, the study revealed that previous political FCI user research ignored health belief variables (health consciousness, perceived severity, and perceived susceptibility), which also influenced FCI usage. Moreover, critical prosuming literacy, a key predictor of sharing and disseminating misinformation, has a strong causal relationship with FCI seeking and sharing. The findings expand the notion of fact-checking from a type of journalism to information and information services and suggest that fact-checking has the potential to become an expanded information service in which experts in broader areas can participate.","[Lee, Jee Yeon] Yonsei Univ, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, 423 Widang Hall,50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Seo, Jungsun] Korean Lib Assoc Lib Inst, 201 Banpo Daero, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Lee, JY (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, 423 Widang Hall,50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",Julie9324@kla.kr; jlee01@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2022S1A5C2A0309359721],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2022S1A5C2A0309359721).,,94,0,0,4,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0024-2667,1865-8423,,LIBRI,Libri,MAR 25,2024,74,1,,,,,71,83,,10.1515/libri-2023-0028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/libri-2023-0028,,NOV 2023,13,Information Science & Library Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Information Science & Library Science,NJ9P4,,Bronze,,,2024-08-19,WOS:001099741400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Guided by Broom et al.'s (1997) foundational three-stage model of OPRs, this study contributes to the public relations literature by conducting the first meta-analysis of the associations between each of the four dimensions of OPRs (trust, satisfaction, commitment, and control mutuality) and their most frequently studied antecedents and consequences. A total of 454 correlations from 67 empirical studies (N = 30, 223) were included in the analysis. The results confirmed the strong correlations among OPRs and the nine most frequently studied antecedents: engagement, involvement, authenticity, transparency, interactivity, two-way communication, interpersonal communication, mediated communication, and symmetrical communication. The research also confirmed the strong connections among OPRs and six commonly researched consequences: reputation, attitudes, positive word-of-mouth communication, purchase intentions, advocacy, and information seeking. We identified the sampling method, employee-organization relationships (EORs), organization type, and country as significant moderators for certain relationships. Overall, the findings support OPRs as a mature and well-supported theory that continues integrating with other public relations theories. Findings also enrich the three-stage model of OPRs with integrated empirical evidence. Areas for future scholarship are discussed relevant to the insignificant potential moderators, such as channel and crisis topic, along with important limitations in the extant scholarship.","[Ma, Xin; Liu, Brooke Fisher] Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, College Pk, MD USA; [Ma, Liang] Texas Christian Univ, Bob Schieffer Coll Commun, Dept Strateg Commun, Ft Worth, TX USA; [Ma, Xin] Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, 4300 Chapel Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Texas Christian University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Ma, X (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, 4300 Chapel Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",xinma@umd.edu,"Ma, Xin/AFC-8233-2022","Ma, Xin/0000-0001-6250-7737",,,,,167,0,0,8,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

The Misinformation Recognition and Response Model (MRRM) provides a framework for investigating the antecedents to and consequences of misinformation recognition. The model theorizes that how people cope with exposure to misinformation and/or intervention messages is conditioned by both dispositional and situational individual characteristics and is part of a process mediated by informational problem identification, issue motivation, and-crucially-recognition of misinformation. Whether or not recognition is activated then triggers differential cognitive coping strategies which ultimately affect consequent cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes. Working to explore the notion of misinformation will be more fruitful if researchers take into consideration how various perspectives fit together and form a larger picture. The MRRM offers guidance on a multi-disciplinary understanding of recognizing and responding to misinformation.","[Amazeen, Michelle A.] Boston Univ, Dept Mass Commun Advertising & Publ Relat, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Amazeen, MA (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Mass Commun Advertising & Publ Relat, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",mamazeen@bu.edu,,"Amazeen, Michelle/0000-0003-0167-7323","Thank you to Dr. Arunima Krishna for her enthusiasm for and encouragement of theory development, in general, and for her insights on this manuscript in particular.

Therefore, the current study aims to explore the affective, cognitive, and behavioral consequences of information-seeking and avoidance behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a secondary analysis of a four-wave online survey of a sample of German residents (n = 492), we conducted hybrid models allowing us to differentiate between within-person effects of information behaviors on the outcomes and between-person correlations between information behaviors and outcomes. The findings revealed only single and small effects of information behaviors. Cognitive consequences such as risk perceptions were influenced by information seeking, whereas information seeking and avoidance affected individuals' subjective but not their objective level of knowledge. Neither information seeking nor avoidance impacted affective responses or a variety of behavioral consequences. These results contrast with assumptions that information seeking is per se a desirable health outcome, whereas information avoidance might be a barrier to health prevention and pandemic containment. At least in times of a health crisis, the findings suggest that information behavior might not be the central determinant of various affective, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes.","[Link, Elena] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Leuppert, Robin; Baumann, Eva] Hanover Univ Mus, Dept Journalism & Commun Res, Drama, Greece",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Link, E (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",elena.link@uni-mainz.de,,"Baumann, Eva/0000-0002-2357-2138; Leuppert, Robin/0000-0001-8940-9985; Link, Elena/0000-0001-6861-5288","Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany","Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany","The work featured in this article was supported by the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany.",,69,0,0,15,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1081-0730,1087-0415,,J HEALTH COMMUN,J.

The model aims to explain the digital publics' communicative behaviors. It suggests five propositions by introducing three different working self-concepts (individual, relational, and collective self) on the issue. The different self-concepts affect involvement recognition and induce different self-oriented motivations (self-interest, interpersonal, and intragroup motivations) and self-oriented communication (I-oriented, You-oriented, and Us/Them-oriented communicative actions).

It supports patients to cope with medical and health-related uncertainties and enables them to engage in informed decision-making. To obtain health information, patients can turn to a variety of sources, such as going to a physician, exchanging information with their family, or using different Internet sources. Research showed that patients typically use multiple sources to meet their health-related information needs. To attain a holistic and differentiated picture of patients' actual health information behavior, the current study draws on the repertoire approach. We conducted an online survey with 1,105 implant patients and performed a cluster analysis to explore their health information repertoires. To gain a deeper understanding of the practical meaning behind the repertoires, we also considered health-related information motives and socio-structural factors, as well as the implant type (dental, orthopedic, cochlear), to characterize the repertoires. The study revealed seven different health information repertoires of implant patients, varying in their combination of multiple sources used. In addition, group comparisons showed that the repertoires differ significantly regarding socio-structural factors, such as gender, age, and education, as well as implant type. Furthermore, information motives contribute significantly to the differentiation of the repertoires. The results are of high theoretical potential for communication science as well as practical use for strategic health communication.","[Fisse, Tanja; Schrimpff, Charlotte; Baumann, Eva; Klimmt, Christoph] Hanover Univ Mus Drama & Media, Dept Journalism & Commun Res, Hannover, Germany; [Link, Elena] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany; [Fisse, Tanja] Hanover Univ Mus Drama & Media, Dept Journalism & Commun Res, Expo Plaza 12, D-30539 Hannover, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Fisse, T (corresponding author), Hanover Univ Mus Drama & Media, Dept Journalism & Commun Res, Expo Plaza 12, D-30539 Hannover, Germany.",tanja.fisse@ijk.hmtm-hannover.de,"Schrimpff, Charlotte/KXQ-7293-2024","Schrimpff, Charlotte/0000-0003-0096-6799; Link, Elena/0000-0001-6861-5288","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [SFB/TRR-298-SIIRI]; [426335750]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG));","This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - SFB/TRR-298-SIIRI - Project-ID [426335750].",,72,1,1,5,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1041-0236,1532-7027,,HEALTH COMMUN,Health Commun.,2023 SEP 18,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/10410236.2023.2258597,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2023.2258597,,SEP 2023,15,Communication; Health Policy & Services,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Health Care Sciences & Services,S2GQ9,37733032,,,,2024-08-19,WOS:001069408800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, this study aims to investigate (1) how ethical perception of a social issue affects situational motivation that leads to participation in public activism, and (2) how emotional outrage plays a role in mediating between situational motivation and activism behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The study aims at investigating the mediating role of emotional outrage between situational motivation and activism behaviors, which have not been investigated thoroughly in public relations research. By conducting a national survey with 386 people (N 5386) living in Australia, the study's suggestivemodel was tested in the context of two ethical issues (e.g. climate change and anti-racism). This study found that people who perceive an ethical issue are likely to be motivated to participate in activism behaviors. Specifically, three situational perceptions (i.e. problem recognition, constraint recognition and involvement recognition) were found to be significant factors affecting situational motivation (SM) in problem solving. A high level of emotional outrage was found to play a mediating role between SM and consequential ethical activism behaviors. The more people feel outraged about an ethical issue, the more likely they will engage in punitive behavior. This study contributes to the theoretical development of public relations by illuminating how situational perceptions lead to emotional outrage that promotes behavioral intentions in an ethical context. This study also suggests that a practitioner should be sought to manage the levels of perceptual factors when setting up a communication plan in response to an ethical public crisis. Findings - This study found that people who perceive an ethical issue are likely to be motivated to participate in activism behaviors. Specifically, three situational perceptions (i.e. problem recognition, constraint recognition and involvement recognition) were found to be significant factors affecting situational motivation (SM) in problem solving. A high level of emotional outrage was found to play a mediating role between SM and consequential ethical activism behaviors. The more people feel outraged about an ethical issue, the more likely they will engage in punitive behavior. Research limitations/implications - This study substantiates how three perceptual antecedents may conjointly affect situational motivation. Also, the findings in this study also contribute to theoretical development in predicting ethical activism intentions. Another contribution of this study is to demonstrate the mediating role of emotional outrage between situational motivation and ethical activism. The authors strived to explore individuals' perceptions and its impact on intention to boycott against ethical problematic social issues. It should be considered that this study used a hypothetical and manipulated situation where respondents are exposed to the visual stimuli that focus on themoral problems that those specific issues have raised. Practical implications - First, as problem recognition plays a prime mover role in the overall problem-solving process in an ethical context, organizations should reduce individual's ethical problem recognition. When setting up a communication plan, an organization should showcase their positive role in addressing the ethical problems (e.g. to show Adani's commitment to indigenous people and efforts to protect the environment). The response strategy should be effective enough to create an ethical dilemma, which refers to a situation in which one has a difficult choice to make between two ethical options. Originality/value - This study contributes to theoretical development of public relations by illuminating how situational perceptions lead to emotional outrage that promotes behavioral intentions in an ethical context. This study also suggests that a practitioner should be sought to manage the levels of perceptual factors when setting up a communication plan in response to an ethical public crisis.","[Shim, KyuJin] IE Univ, IE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain; [Kim, Young] Marquette Univ, Diederich Coll Commun, Milwaukee, WI USA; [Chang, ChihYao] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia",IE University; Marquette University; University of Melbourne,"Shim, K (corresponding author), IE Univ, IE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain.",kyu.shim@ie.edu,"Kim, Young/Q-5459-2019; Shim, Kyu Jin/P-4585-2018","Shim, Kyu Jin/0000-0001-6391-1854",This study is funded by University of Melbourne for data collection.; University of Melbourne,This study is funded by University of Melbourne for data collection.; University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne),This study is funded by University of Melbourne for data collection.,,75,0,0,5,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3289,1758-6046,,CORP COMMUN,Corp.

Additionally, it adopts a relationship management perspective and acknowledges the significance of general interest toward a country can be considered a manifestation of soft power. To support these arguments, the study employs a secondary data analysis study design with a sample size of 1550, collected by the Korean Cultural Center in Indonesia in 2016. The t-test results demonstrate that voluntary indirect experience (watching Korean dramas) significantly impacts increased interest in Korea and individuals' pro-Korea communication actions (i.e., positive megaphoning). On the other hand, the direct experience (visiting South Korea) does not show a significant impact. In the multiple regression analysis, it is found that general interest in Korea, which represents an ongoing relationship between a country and foreign publics, makes the impact of direct experience and indirect experience disappear. The study offers a new approach to quantify soft power empirically and highlights the importance of general interest as a concept that aids researchers in examining the value of maintaining relationships.","[Yeo, SunHa; Eschbach, Alex] Univ Oklahoma, Gaylord Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Norman, OK USA; [Lee, Hyelim] Washington State Univ, Edward R Murrow Coll Commun, Pullman, WA 99163 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Washington State University,"Lee, H (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Edward R Murrow Coll Commun, Pullman, WA 99163 USA.",hyelima@gmail.com,"Lee, Hyelim/ABV-7242-2022","Lee, Hyelim/0000-0001-9032-9835",,,,,86,0,0,0,2,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1751-8040,1751-8059,,PLACE BRANDING PUBLI,Place Branding Public Dipl.,JUN,2024,20,2,,,,,130,141,,10.1057/s41254-023-00309-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41254-023-00309-2,,AUG 2023,12,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,SI9P0,,,,,2024-08-19,WOS:001044855400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results showed that laissez-faire leadership and employees' engagement in negative megaphoning behavior were positively related. There was also a strong and positive association between perceived organizational justice and employee-organization relationships. Employees' relationships with the organization were negatively related to employees' engagement in negative megaphoning behavior.

The current study aims to examine the voice behaviors of employees generated around the issue of CSI. Two online surveys were administered to fulltime employees by using two different scenarios involving CSI situations: environmental and diversity issues. The results of the study identified employees' pre-established organizational identification as a critical crosssituational factor that influenced their CSI perceptions. In addition, employees' situational perceptions of CSI - how they perceive CSI as a serious problem, their sense of connection to the situation, and their perceived constraints in solving the situation - played critical roles in motivating them to engage in voice behavior. Furthermore, the level of power distance culture within an organization significantly moderated the relationship between employees' CSI perceptions and voice behavior. By incorporating organizational identification literature and public relations theory in the context of CSI communication and management, this study provides theoretical and practical implications.","[Kim, Katie Haejung; Rim, Hyejoon] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 111 Murphy Hall,206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Rim, H (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 111 Murphy Hall,206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",hrim@umn.edu,,"Rim, Hyejoon/0000-0002-0357-4750",,,,,84,5,5,14,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

We hypothesized and confirmed with a nationally representative sample that individuals' perceptions, feelings, and communicative actions about an issue are positively associated with the communicative resources in their networks. Individuals' substantive actions were mobilized by the norms and expectations perceived from their issue discussants (i.e., people who discuss an issue with them).

Aiming at influencing individual attitudes towards hot-button issues and meeting the heightened public expectations for CSA, an increasing number of businesses are engaging in CSA initiatives. Therefore, it is critical to uncover how publics' perceptions of CSA messages influence the effectiveness of strategic CSA communication on social outcomes. Moreover, when corporations risk alienating certain subgroups of publics, more research is needed to assess how publics' perceptions of CSA messages affect organizational relationship building, and how such influence is contingent on individual differences pertaining to the focal political/social issues. An online survey with 530 responses supports a moderated mediation model of CSA messaging perceptions with organization-public relationships and issue advocacy behaviors as outcomes. Grounded in the persuasion knowledge model and elaboration likelihood model, this interdisciplinary study contributes to the broad understanding of the strategic CSA communication process by crystalizing the effectiveness of CSA message informativeness and factual message tone, uncovering the key mediating mechanism of CSA credibility, as well as establishing the individual factor of involvement recognition as a boundary condition for the CSA message strategies.","[Song, Baobao] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Coll Humanities & Sci, Richard T Robertson Sch Media & Culture, Room 2208C, 901 West Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Choi, Minhee] Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Lubbock, TX USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Song, BB (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Coll Humanities & Sci, Richard T Robertson Sch Media & Culture, Room 2208C, 901 West Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",bsong@vcu.edu,,,,,,,90,3,3,5,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1553-118X,1553-1198,,INT J STRATEG COMMUN,Int.

To extend current research, this study examines the effects of institutional trust and demographic factors (i.e., age, gender, political ideology, household income and education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics [STEM]) in explaining conspiracy orientation (i.e., the dispositional tendency to subscribe to different conspiracy theories) and conspiracy attribution (i.e., the situational tendency to subscribe to conspiracy theories about specific problematic situations). A survey dataset (N = 720) was collected in South Korea. The findings showed that institutional trust had greater effects than STEM education in explaining conspiracy orientation and attribution.

With the popularity of the internet, online health information-seeking behavior (OHISB) has been widely adopted to improve health and prevent disease. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of different types of OHISBs on STDs, including syphilis, gonorrhea, and AIDS due to HIV, based on the Baidu index. Methods: Multisource big data were collected, including case numbers of STDs, search queries based on the Baidu index, provincial total population, male-female ratio, the proportion of the population older than 65 years, gross regional domestic product (GRDP), and health institution number data in 2011-2018 in mainland China. We categorized OHISBs into 4 types: concept, symptoms, treatment, and prevention. Before and after controlling for socioeconomic and medical conditions, we applied multiple linear regression to analyze associations between the Baidu search index (BSI) and Baidu search rate (BSR) and STD case numbers. In addition, we compared the effects of 4 types of OHISBs and performed time lag cross-correlation analyses to investigate the long-term effect of OHISB. Results: The distributions of both STD case numbers and OHISBs presented variability. For case number, syphilis, and gonorrhea, cases were mainly distributed in southeastern and northwestern areas of China, while HIV/AIDS cases were mostly distributed in southwestern areas. For the search query, the eastern region had the highest BSI and BSR, while the western region had the lowest ones. For 4 types of OHISB for 3 diseases, the BSI was positively related to the case number, while the BSR was significantly negatively related to the case number (P<.05). Different categories of OHISB have different effects on STD case numbers. Searches for prevention tended to have a larger impact, while searches for treatment tended to have a smaller impact. Besides, due to the time lag effect, those impacts would increase over time. Conclusions: Our study validated the significant associations between 4 types of OHISBs and STD case numbers, and the impact of OHISBs on STDs became stronger over time. It may provide insights into how to use internet big data to better achieve disease surveillance and prevention goals.","[Li, Xuan; Tang, Kun] Tsinghua Univ, Vanke Sch Publ Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tang, Kun] Tsinghua Univ, Vanke Sch Publ Hlth, 30 Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Tang, K (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Vanke Sch Publ Hlth, 30 Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",tangkun@post.harvard.edu,,"Li, Xuan/0000-0001-7366-7517",,,,,46,4,4,8,17,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

This paper examines how risk perception changed from before and six months after Hurricane Irma, a Category 3 storm that narrowly missed Sarasota County, FL. Both surveys asked about residents' hurricane risk perceptions, evacuation behaviors, mitigation plans, and attitudes about self-efficacy. For each question found in both surveys, the research used t-tests (alpha = 0.05) to assess whether significant changes in risk perceptions occurred between responses. The results suggest that Hurricane Irma had a notable impact on risk perception. The changes were most evident in reported levels of self-efficacy as residents were less likely to feel able to sufficiently prepare for or recover from hurricane impacts after Hurricane Irma. Respondents were also more likely to believe individuals are responsible for preparing for hurricane impacts. The findings have implications for public risk communicators, who may find it effective and sustainable to appeal to residents' lowered self-efficacy or sense of responsibility for the dangers of hurricanes while implementing policies and communication strategies.","[Billman, Matthew; Thompson, Courtney] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Atoba, Kayode; Brody, Samuel] Texas A&M Univ, Inst Disaster Resilient Texas, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Brody, Samuel] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine & Coastal Environm Sci, Galveston, TX 77554 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System,"Atoba, K (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Inst Disaster Resilient Texas, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",matthew.billman.168@gmail.com; kayodeatoba@tamu.edu; Cthompson24@tamu.edu,"Thompson, Courtney/AAA-7823-2021","Thompson, Courtney/0000-0001-5082-4540; Atoba, Kayode/0000-0003-4616-7917","National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Gulf Research Early-Career","National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Gulf Research Early-Career","This research was funded by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Gulf Research Early-Career Fellowship Program.",,89,2,2,2,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY 7,2023,15,9,,,,,,,7680,10.3390/su15097680,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15097680,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,G2WH6,,gold,,,2024-08-19,WOS:000987816800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

After reviewing the functional/issue-based approaches and the non-functional/discursive-based approaches to theorizing publics within public relations research, we note the significance of the stranger relationality and temporality that is invoked when considering the circulation of discourse and texts as the basis for public existence. We suggest four premises to a rhetorical understanding of publics, expanding upon the public relations literature that has previously suggested a discursive nature of publics, but has not articulated the consequential details of public formation, maintenance, and existence. These premises decenter the organization by highlighting the circulation of and attention to texts, emphasize public existence as allowing a fluidity of participation, suggest further understanding belonging rather than behavior, and underscore questions of temporality and collective memory. We then suggest some implications for public relations research, including how a rhetorical understanding connects to the non-functional approaches of the field, as well as how it may extend studies of relationships and counterpublics.","[Iannacone, Jeannette I.; Ashby-King, Drew T.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Iannacone, JI (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, 2130 Skinner Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jcone@umd.edu,,"Iannacone, Jeannette/0000-0002-0245-6592",,,,,116,3,4,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Modeling the full text of all 1,293 published articles in Public Relations Review (PRR) and the Journal of Public Relations Research (JPRR) from 2010 to 2020 (7,400,685 words), we identified nine non-discrete clusters in public relations research. Using three computational methods - structural topic modeling, inter-cluster network analysis, and network simulation - we found that (1) the strategic management cluster emerged as the most central for the past decade, followed by public relations professionalism, digital media, crisis communication, internal communication, global public relations, rhetoric and philosophy, media relations, and critical studies, ranked by their proportions in the scholarship; (2) JPRR had greater emphasis on the strategic management cluster relative to PRR, which offered a more diverse representation; (3) little longitudinal change occurred throughout the decade, although internal communication gained traction and public relations professionalism and media relations lost ground as the decade progressed; and 4) the last ten years of public relations research did not see intersection among theoretical traditions from different clusters as much as expected, leaving opportunity for more inter-cluster knowledge production. Theoretical and practical implications for the public relations research community are discussed.","[Zhou, Alvin] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Capizzo, Luke W.] Univ Missouri, Sch Journalism, Columbia, MO USA; [Page, Tyler G.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Commun, Stamford, CT USA; [Toth, Elizabeth L.] Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, College Pk, MD USA; [Zhou, Alvin] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Connecticut; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Zhou, AL (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",alvinyxz@umn.edu,"Zhou, Alvin/L-3760-2019; Capizzo, Luke/KXT-7129-2024","Zhou, Alvin/0000-0001-5410-9712; Capizzo, Luke/0000-0002-5813-8219; Page, Tyler/0000-0001-9058-1635",,,,,142,6,6,5,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1062-726X,1532-754X,,J PUBLIC RELAT RES,J.

However, little is known about how threats and emotions during natural disasters impact media usage for information seeking and sharing. This study examined the relationship between the perceived threat of disasters (including disaster severity and involvement recognition), negative emotions, and information seeking and forwarding/sharing via different types of media. We surveyed over 600 adults in U.S. counties impacted by Hurricane Florence in 2018. Our findings show that negative crisis emotions mediated the relationship between threat appraisals and information seeking and sharing behaviors. In our discussion, we suggest how disaster/emergency communication professionals can prepare and respond to disasters by knowing how emotions influence individuals' communicative behaviors.","[Austin, Lucinda] Univ N Carolina, Hussman Sch Journalism & Media, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Kim, Seoyeon] Univ Alabama, Coll Commun & Informat Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Saffer, Adam J.

We explored the effects of three motivations, i.e., situational motivation, concern-for-self and concern-for-others motivation, and their antecedents on individual online and offline preventive actions. We used PLS-SEM to analyze the results of 628 questionnaires and found that: first, individual online preventive actions have a positive predictive effect on offline actions; secondly, individual online preventive actions are positively affected by situational motivation and concern-for-others motivation, and individual offline preventive actions are positively affected by concern-for-self and concern-for-others motivation; finally, three situational perceptual factors including problem, involvement and constraint recognition have significant effects on the three motivations.

J,"Diers-Lawson, A","Diers-Lawson, Audra",,,iScotland: building a unified model of activism in multi-platform communication environments from traditional PR theory,CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS,,,English,Article,Social movements; Scotland; Affective injustice; Situational motivation for activism; Hostile media; Activism; Online activism,SOCIAL MEDIA; DATA SATURATION; INFORMATION,"PurposeIn recent years, there has been a growth in research aimed at understanding the foundations of modern activist communication in media-rich and multi-platform environments. For example, Chon and Park's analysis of the American Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement built on Kim and Grunig's STOPS model. Yet, social and political injustice can exist for extended periods of time without successful movements emerging, so what leads people to demand social and political change through activism? This paper posits that crisis is trigger that motivates people to activism and evaluates that within the context of the Scottish independence movement.Design/methodology/approachThe study is based on in-depth interviews with 26 advocates for Scottish independence, which yielded more than 32 h of data. Data were analysed using Strauss and Corbin's (1990) constant comparative method approach using open coding, axial coding and selective coding finding thematic saturation after only 10 interviews.FindingsThe study provides a clear extension of Chon and Park's model of activism by finding that crises are critical triggers for activism. Moreover, these findings also provide insights into not only the Scottish independence movement but more broadly the extension of traditional public relations and communication theory in multi-platform and multi-actor environments.Originality/valueThere are several contributions this piece makes. First, this paper extends activist, crisis and strategic communication research to more systematically consider the role that crisis plays in social and political advocacy. Second, this paper affords the opportunity to consider the challenges of communication, democracy and activism in the social media age. Finally, this paper supports an international view that discrimination and affective injustice experiences cut across many different kinds of identities and experiences instead of the traditionally considered ethnic, religious and gender-based experiences traditionally addressed.","[Diers-Lawson, Audra] Kristiania Univ Coll, Inst Commun, Oslo, Norway",Kristiania University College,"Diers-Lawson, A (corresponding author), Kristiania Univ Coll, Inst Commun, Oslo, Norway.",Audra.Diers-Lawson@kristiania.no,,,,,,,47,0,0,3,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3289,1758-6046,,CORP COMMUN,Corp.

This study proposes a moderated mediation model of information behaviors (e.g. information seeking and information verification) and trust in government that explores the relationship between risk perception and preventive behaviors regarding COVID-19. Using a survey study in South Korea, we conducted the moderated mediation analysis with latent moderated structural equation modeling (LMS). We found serial mediation effects for risk perception, information behaviors, and preventive behaviors, as people both seek out information and verify that information before adopting preventive behaviors. Additionally, trust in government moderated information behaviors in the relationship between risk perception and preventive behaviors, suggesting that trust in government encourages people to adopt more preventive actions via information seeking and information verification. Further implications are discussed to promote public understanding of the health crisis and public participation in preventive measures.","[Jeong, Jae-Seon] Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Appl Social Res, Debiasing & Lay Informat DaLI Lab, Norman, OK USA; [Kim, Soo Yun] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Commun, Edinburg, TX USA; [Kim, Soo Yun] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Commun, 1201 Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Kim, SY (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Commun, 1201 Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",sooyun.kim@utrgv.edu,,,,,,,77,7,7,16,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1041-0236,1532-7027,,HEALTH COMMUN,Health Commun.,JAN 28,2024,39,2,,,,,376,387,,10.1080/10410236.2023.2166698,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2023.2166698,,JAN 2023,12,Communication; Health Policy & Services,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Health Care Sciences & Services,FE7Z5,36650123,,,,2024-08-19,WOS:000913248800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Through interviews with 25 supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement, we used the circuit of culture to build theory about the production and consumption of messages. Specifically, we examined the ways in which meaning was produced, interpreted, and contested in the context of a social movement occurring inside of a global pandemic. We engaged in theoretical bricolage by demonstrating how perspective by incongruity, appropriation, and the referent criterion can shape meaning within the context of the circuit of culture.

Results of the two experiments suggest that while issue contention does not lower consumers' agency, it makes consumers less likely to engage the organization based on their values and beliefs (i.e., symbolic avoidance) regardless of the organization's viewpoints. The results also suggest that this effect does not directly extend to actual purchase intention, which indicates that actual purchase intention is confounded by both symbolic interactions and tangible factors such as price and corporate expertise. Results of the two experiments provide important implications for public relations research, challenging the dyadic assumptions of organization -public interactions and relationships and calling for further attention on inter-publics and inter-organizations dynamics.","[Xu, Sifan; Cho, Moonhee] Univ Tenneseee, Tombras Sch Advertising & Publ Relat, Knoxville, TN USA; [Xu, Sifan] 476 Commun Bldg,1345 Circle Pk Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",,"Xu, SF (corresponding author), 476 Commun Bldg,1345 Circle Pk Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",sifanxu@utk.edu,,"Xu, Sifan/0000-0001-8669-950X; Cho, Moonhee/0000-0002-5572-4714",,,,,64,3,3,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

The low ratio of fully vaccinated people and the emergence of renewed infectious variants correspond to worsening public health. Global health managers have highlighted COVID-19 vaccine-related infodemics as a significant risk perception factor hindering mass vaccination campaigns. Objective: Given the ambiguous digital communication environment that has fostered infodemics, resource-limited nations struggle to boost public willingness to encourage people to fully vaccinate. Authorities have launched some risk communication-laden digital interventions in response to infodemics. However, the value of the risk communication strategies used to tackle infodemics needs to be evaluated. The current research using the tenets of the Situational Theory of Problem Solving is novel, as it explores the impending effects of risk communication strategies. The relationship between infodemic-induced risk perception of COVID-19 vaccine safety and risk communication actions to intensify willingness to be fully vaccinated was examined. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional research design vis-a-vis a nationally representative web-based survey. We collected data from 1946 internet users across Pakistan. Participants voluntarily participated in this research after completing the consent form and reading ethical permissions. Responses were received over 3 months, from May 2022 to July 2022. Results: The results delineated that infodemics positively affected risk perception. This realization pushed the public to engage in risky communicative actions through reliance on and searches for accurate information. Therefore, the prospect of managing infodemics through risk information exposure (eg, digital interventions) using the situational context could predict robust willingness to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Conclusions: These pioneering results offer strategic considerations for health authorities to effectively manage the descending spiral of optimal protection against COVID-19. This research concludes that the likelihood of managing infodemics using situational context through exposure to relevant information could improve one's knowledge of forfending and selection, which can lead to robust protection against COVID-19. Hence, more situation-specific information about the underlying problem (ie, the selection of an appropriate vaccine) can be made accessible through several official digital sources to achieve a more active public health response.","[Jin, Qiang] Hebei Univ, Intercultural Commun Res Ctr, Baoding, Peoples R China; [Raza, Syed Hassan; Shah, Amjad Ali] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Multan, Pakistan; [Yousaf, Muhammad] Univ Gujrat, Ctr Media & Commun Studies, Gujrat, Pakistan; [Zaman, Umer] Woosong Univ, Endicott Coll Int Studies, Daejeon, South Korea; [Ogadimma, Emenyeonu C.] Univ Sharjah, Coll Commun, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Core, Rachel] Stetson Univ, Sociol & Anthropol Dept, Deland, FL USA; [Malik, Aqdas] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Muscat, Oman; [Raza, Syed Hassan] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Bosan Rd, Multan 60000, Pakistan",Hebei University; Bahauddin Zakariya University; University of Gujrat; Woosong University; University of Sharjah; Stetson University; Sultan Qaboos University; Bahauddin Zakariya University,"Raza, SH (corresponding author), Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Bosan Rd, Multan 60000, Pakistan.",sherazibzu@gmail.com,"Raza, Syed Hassan/I-7274-2017; Yousaf, Muhammad/AAZ-4017-2020; SHAH, AMJAD ALI/HJX-9507-2023","Raza, Syed Hassan/0000-0002-1318-7818; Yousaf, Muhammad/0000-0003-3203-2966; SHAH, AMJAD ALI/0000-0001-6449-1476; Core, Rachel/0000-0002-0550-887X; Emenyeonu, Ogadimma/0000-0002-8918-7419; Zaman, Umer/0000-0002-3729-3543",,,,,53,1,1,3,5,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",,2561-326X,,JMIR FORM RES,JMIR Form.

This study investigates how people discussed COVID-19 in relation to mental health on Twitter. Using Crimson Hexagon, this research examines tweets (N = 2,199,625) for three months following the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States and includes a quantitative analysis of the public's concern about the disease as well as a qualitative thematic analysis of conversations on the topic (n = 800). Results indicate that those who discuss mental health online behave as an active and aware public that recognizes how mental health can be affected during a health crisis. The quantitative analysis shows that when cases of the disease increased, mentions of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and psychologists also increased. Additionally, as deaths related to the disease increased, so did mentions of psychologists. Qualitative statistics indicate that this public makes a concerted effort to provide social support and solidarity for others.","[King, Jesse] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Halversen, Audrey] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Morrow, Olivia; Brubaker, Pamela] Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Westhoff, Whitney] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Brigham Young University; Harvard University,"King, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",jesseking@ucsb.edu; audreyha@umich.edu; olivia.morrow@byu.edu; westhoff.whitney@gmail.com; pamela_brubaker@byu.edu,,,,,,,45,0,0,1,3,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

It is important for health organizations to increase vaccine acceptance. Addressing this issue, this study aimed to predict citizens' acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine through a synthetic approach of public segmentation including cross-situational and situational variables. Controlling for demographics, we examined institutional trust, negative attitudes toward, and low levels of knowledge about vaccines (ie, lacuna public characteristics), and fear of COVID-19 during the pandemic. Our study provides a useful framework for public segmentation and contributes to risk and health campaigns by identifying significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Method:We conducted an online survey on October 10, 2020 (N = 499), and performed hierarchical regression analyses to predict citizens' COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Results:This study demonstrated that trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and federal government, vaccine attitude, problem recognition, constraint recognition, involvement recognition, and fear positively predicted COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Conclusions:This study outlines a useful synthetic public segmentation framework and extends the concept of lacuna public to the pandemic context, helping to predict vaccine acceptance. Importantly, the findings could be useful in designing health campaign messages.","[Chon, Myoung-Gi] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, Auburn, AL USA; [Kim, Sungsu] Kookmin Univ, Sch Commun, Seoul, South Korea",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Kookmin University,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Kookmin Univ, Sch Commun, Seoul, South Korea.",sungsukim@kookmin.ac.kr,,,,,,,29,2,2,1,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1935-7893,1938-744X,,DISASTER MED PUBLIC,Dis.

To this end, a wide sample of corporate activism cases were analysed using an event analysis approach to identify the effect of two key variables: (a) the controversial nature of the sector and (b) the type of activism. The results show that corporate activism actions have positive effects when the sector is not perceived as controversial, and negative when the type of activism is based on social rights.

To do so, it delves into the writing and advocacy of two trail-blazing women who dedicated their lives and work to empowering and protecting their communities: Grace Lee Boggs and Jane Jacobs. By connecting their approaches with existing public relations scholarship around community, activism, and place, the authors present a set of place-making communicative approaches for community activist practice in addition to theoretical development around what Boggs (2000) refers to as place-based civic activism (p. 19)-the work of finding and harnessing a shared neighborhood identity to connect and empower local residents as citizens. Seeing community and activism through this lens points toward the complex, living, and evolving ecology of communities (Jacobs, 1961, 2000), and positions public relations and activist communication as crucial tools for place-making.","[Capizzo, Luke] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Madden, Stephanie] Penn State Univ, State Coll, PA USA; [Capizzo, Luke] Univ Missouri, Sch Journalism, 120 Neff Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Capizzo, L (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Sch Journalism, 120 Neff Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",capizzol@missouri.edu,"Capizzo, Luke/IZD-9877-2023; Capizzo, Luke/KXT-7129-2024; Capizzo, Luke/HKF-7281-2023","Capizzo, Luke/0000-0002-5813-8219; Madden, Stephanie/0000-0003-0278-9634",,,,,109,7,7,6,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Two narrative counter strategies to address misinformation about the safety of the MMR vaccine (i.e., personal stories of uneventful vaccinations where a parent talks about how their child was vaccinated and no injury happened to them, and narratives of anti-vax to pro-vax conversions, where a former anti-vaccine parent narrates their experience of their child getting sick with a vaccine-preventable disease and thus realizing the importance of vaccines) were compared to a non-narrative counter message (an infographic, in the case of the present study) in increasing belief in the counter, reducing vaccine misinformation, and increasing MMR vaccination intentions. Second, we tested a theoretically grounded model predicting MMR vaccination intentions and misinformation amplification likelihood, combining pre-existing issue-specific situational motivation in problem solving with perceived counter and misinformation source credibility and message effects.

Individuals who are suffering from mental health problems tend to obtain health information and social support in the digital media environment. However, there has been little research on how information-seeking and information-forwarding behaviors affect sufferers' coping processes and outcomes. Based on communicative behaviors of people in online to solve health problmes, this study aims to apply two cybercoping modes proposed by previous reserach to mental health issues.MethodUsing anxiety and depression issues, this study conducted an online survey (N = 560) to examine two cybercoping models with data collected from an online crowdsourcing platform (Amazon's Mechanical Turk). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test the cybercoping models in the context of mental health issues.ResultsResults of the first cybercoping model showed that information seeking was positively associated with coping outcomes, whereas information forwarding was not significant. While information seeking in the second cybercoping model was significantly associated with other factors, information forwarding was not significant. The second model revealed that coping processes fully mediate between information seeking and cybercoping outcomes.ConclusionsThis study contributes to the theoretical building of cybercoping models in the context of mental health issues by illustrating the effects of information seeking on cybercoping outcomes. Health care practitioners may use these results to better understand which communicative processes in online mental health communication are positively associated with specific coping processes and outcomes.","[Chon, Myoung-Gi] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, 237 Tichenor Hall, Auburn, AL 36830 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Chon, MG (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, 237 Tichenor Hall, Auburn, AL 36830 USA.",mzc0113@auburn.edu,,"Chon, Myoung-Gi/0000-0002-6586-6863",,,,,41,1,1,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-8068,1753-8076,,J COMMUN HEALTHC,J.

Using an online survey of members of a state museum (n = 363), this study found support for how individuals process organizational messages. Specifically, individuals that perceive a strong relationship with an organization are more likely to seek out information from or about that organization. After seeking out information, individuals filter messaging to keep the most helpful content while ignoring other content before ultimately sharing those messages with their personal network. Through sequential mediation analysis, the data supports the hypothesized order of active communication processes and extends the conceptual linkages discussed by nonprofit management literature between organization-public relationships and behavioral outcomes.","[Pressgrove, Geah] West Virginia Univ, Reed Coll Media, 1511 Univ Ave, Morgantown, WV 26501 USA; [McKeever, Robert; McKeever, Brooke] Univ South Carolina, Coll Informat & Commun, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Waters, Richard] Univ San Francisco, Sch Management, San Francisco, CA USA",West Virginia University; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of San Francisco,"Pressgrove, G (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Reed Coll Media, 1511 Univ Ave, Morgantown, WV 26501 USA.",Geah.Pressgrove@mail.wvu.edu,"McKeever, Brooke W./KMA-3828-2024; McKeever, Robert/JWA-2387-2024","McKeever, Brooke W./0000-0002-2607-5217;",,,,,78,0,1,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1049-5142,1540-6997,,J NONPROFIT PUBLIC S,J.

In order to investigate the role of information gaining on public acceptance in various LIPs, this study combined situational theory of publics (STP) and theory of rational actions (TRA), while a Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) facility and a non-NIMBY facility were selected for a comparative case study. Face-to-face interview surveys were conducted, and the relationship between information gaining and public acceptance was explored via two structural equation models. The results show that: (1) Information gaining has no significant effect on the public acceptance of NIMBY facilities, however, is significantly associated with that of non-NIMBY facilities. (2) Attitudes and subjective norms perform the mediating roles between the main variables in STP and public acceptance. (3) High problem recognition is significantly related to low public acceptance in both cases. For NIMBY facilities, the relationship is mediated by attitudes. By contrast, for non-NIMBY facilities, it is mediated by information gaining and attitudes. (4) People with a high level of involvement are the significant groups that are most likely to engage in information gaining and influence others in both cases. (5) Constraint recognition can motivate the public to communicate with others for the NIMBY facility, yet it could discourage information gaining for the non-NIMBY facility. These findings help authorities to better understand the role of information gaining in public acceptance and to streamline the decision-making process in LIPs.","[Wang, Yang; Ye, Shengnan] Wuhan Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fan] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Jian] Univ Adelaide, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Adelaide 5005, Australia; [Rameezdeen, Raufdeen] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide 5001, Australia",Wuhan University; Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Adelaide; University of South Australia,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",wangyang.whu@foxmail.com,"Zuo, Jian/HPD-5969-2023; Zuo, Jian/M-3223-2016; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen/F-4614-2013","Rameezdeen, Raufdeen/0000-0001-9639-2624",National Natural Science Foundation of China; [71874127],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));,Acknowledgement This research is sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71874127) .,,76,4,4,9,54,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0195-9255,1873-6432,,ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES,Environ.

In particular, we examine how they used digital communication technologies to tap into online resources and social connections both in the United States and their origin country and how various aspects of online information management were associated with their willingness to get vaccinated against the virus. Method: We conducted an online survey and in-depth interviews with international migrants aged 18 64 years who moved to the United States in 2011 or later and were living in two neighboring states in the US Midwest as of spring 2021. Since this research involves understanding how these international migrants dealt with uncertainties related to coronavirus disease 2019 vaccinations, we collected the survey and interview data when each state had a vaccination rate of less than 10% and very limited vaccination eligibility for those aged 64 years and below. Results: Our results show that international migrants perceived uncertainty, positive and negative emotions, efficacy, and outcome expectancy affect their information seeking related to the coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination. In addition, issue salience moderates the effect between information seeking and vaccine willingness.

The results demonstrate that STOPS can be applied to the food safety issue to predict communicative actions of publics, and organizational trust plays a vital role in reducing individuals' concerns about the food safety issue.","[Chon, Myoung-Gi] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Xu, Linjia] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Chinese Language & Literature, 10 Huixin West St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Kim, Jarim] Yonsei Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Liu, Jiaying] Univ Georgia, Dept Commun Studies, Athens, GA 30602 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of International Business & Economics; Yonsei University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Xu, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Chinese Language & Literature, 10 Huixin West St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",xulinjia@uibe.edu.cn,,,Young Scholar Program of National Social Science Funds [19CXW019],Young Scholar Program of National Social Science Funds,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Young Scholar Program of National Social Science Funds, grant number 19CXW019.",,42,4,4,4,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7642,1552-3381,,AM BEHAV SCI,Am.

The results show that exposure to athlete racial advocacy is positively associated with the following types of public issue involvement: 'awareness,' 'concern,' 'knowledge,' and 'information-seeking.' However, the exposure has no significant effect on 'talk frequency.' The results suggest that athlete advocacy can motivate limited types of public involvement in racial issues.

Based on the protective action decision model, this study investigated the key factors underlying individual's interpersonal communication on the Gongkuai campaign, which was carried out during Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The main goal of the Gongkuai campaign was to change traditional communal eating habits and reduce public health risks. An online questionnaire survey involving 618 respondents was conducted in China after the 2020 Gongkuai campaign propagated, and the data were analyzed by using the structural equation modeling technique. The results indicated that health campaign exposure is a critical determinant of perceived campaign-related knowledge and health risk perception, which are significant predictors of interpersonal communication. Meanwhile, campaign-related knowledge can elicit risk perception. Furthermore, campaign exposure influenced interpersonal communication in ways that traditional diet culture did not predict. Risk perception was also unaffected by traditional diet culture. It is worth noting that individuals' agreement with traditional diet culture does not hinder health campaign-generated interpersonal communication in the context of public health crisis.

Specifically, two studies were conducted to investigate how companies' different CSR initiatives in the early stage of COVID-19 would influence consumers' advocacy intention according to their focus (i.e. targets of institutional CSR). The first study examined the moderating role of individuals' CSR expectancy on the effects of companies' CSR initiatives on consumers' brand advocacy intention. The second study further extends the findings of Study 1 by examining the mediating role of perceived brand motive. Design/methodology/approach Two between-subject online experiments were conducted to explore the impact of three types of institutional CSR initiatives (i.e. community, employee and consumer-centered CSRs) on brand advocacy. Study 1 (N = 380) examined the moderating role of CSR expectancy in influencing consumer responses to institutional CSR initiatives. Study 2 (N = 384) explored the underlying mechanism through examining the mediating role of a company's value-driven motivation in the process. Findings Study 1 indicated that institutional CSR, regardless of type, was more effective in generating a more significant brand advocacy intention than a promotional message, measured as a baseline. The impact of different kinds of institutional CSR on consumers' brand advocacy intentions was significantly moderated by their CSR-related expectations. Specifically, individuals with moderate to high CSR expectancy showed higher brand advocacy intentions in both consumer- and employee-centered CSR initiatives than the promotional message. In comparison, those with low CSR expectancy only showed higher brand advocacy intentions in the community-centered CSR initiative. In addition, as individuals' CSR expectations rose, the mediation effect of the perceived value-driven motivation became stronger. Research limitations/implications The current study includes guiding principles to help companies effectively respond to COVID-19 as corporate citizens by demonstrating the importance of individuals' CSR expectancy across three CSR initiatives. This study used real-life examples of how leading companies were stepping up CSR efforts and suggested an approach that aligns CSR behaviors with the urgent and fundamental human needs of COVID-19. Originality/value In line with the CSR goal of maximizing benefits for stakeholders, this study's findings signal that situational changes determine CSR expectations and that companies must be highly susceptible to the changes in consumers' expectations of CSR and their appraisal process of CSR motives to maximize its CSR value.","[Kim, Taeyoung; Yang, Jing; Yim, Myungok Chris] Loyola Univ Chicago, Sch Commun, Chicago, IL 60660 USA",Loyola University Chicago,"Kim, T (corresponding author), Loyola Univ Chicago, Sch Commun, Chicago, IL 60660 USA.",tkim18@luc.edu; jyang13@luc.edu; myim@luc.edu,,"Yim, Myungok Chris/0000-0001-6776-3959",,,,,105,8,8,2,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1061-0421,2054-1643,,J PROD BRAND MANAG,J.

Linking relationship management factors and the framework of the situational theory of problem-solving, the findings of this study demonstrate that authentic communication and relational quality can help increase positive perceptual, attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes desired by governments regarding pandemic management. However, our findings suggested that unproductive uses of authentic governmental communication may create adverse effects on publics' perceptions and interpretations and thus pose potential risks, particularly when a public health issue is significantly politicized. Specifically, this study found that, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic in which the Trump administration was blamed for lack of planning and halting responses in the fight against the virus, conservatives who believe that the federal government is practicing authentic communication during the pandemic would consider the issue less important and irreverent; meanwhile, they would recognize more barriers to adopt preventive actions.

However, few studies have been conducted to determine the efficacy of expressive arts therapy on the resilience of psychologically exposed university students during COVID-19. Furthermore, since network analysis appears to be a popular approach in psychological research, it has not been used in recent intervention studies for resilience. As a result, the current study utilized a network analysis approach to determine the efficacy of expressive arts therapy on the resilience of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 263 students in a comprehensive university in China were selected for the therapy group between March and November 2021. In a pre-post design, students' resilience was assessed using the Resiliency Scale for University Students (RSUS). The extended Bayesian information criteria (EBIC) and graphical LASSO were used to estimate and define paired resilience networks, and the strength, betweenness, and closeness indices were utilized to determine the centrality of the six facets of resilience. Additionally, we verified the stability and accuracy. It was discovered that significant differences appeared between the paired networks before and after expressive arts therapy. Facets of self-efficacy, self-acceptance and problem-solving in resilience were notably improved after the therapy, with the variable of emotional stability sustained at the mean level. Meanwhile, the network analysis has highlighted the central variable of self-efficacy in the pre-intervention and support from friends in the post-intervention. The connectivity among the components of problem solving, support from friends, and support from family was enhanced, with support from friends playing the role of hub nod in the following network. By utilizing a network analytic approach, expressive arts therapy can be more targeted in intervening in resilience mechanisms. As a proxy for efficacious problem-solving, intervention should be calibrated to the cultivation of social support networks, especially in the support from friends.","[Li, Yue] Shenzhen Univ, Div Arts, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Peng, Jun] City Univ Macau, Res Inst Macau Educ Dev, Sch Educ, Macau 999078, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; City University of Macau,"Peng, J (corresponding author), City Univ Macau, Res Inst Macau Educ Dev, Sch Educ, Macau 999078, Peoples R China.",lee@szu.edu.cn; junpeng@cityu.mo,"俊, 彭/KDM-7963-2024","俊, 彭/0000-0003-1802-7300; Li, Yue/0000-0002-4280-5515","2021 Higher Education Fund of the Macao SAR Government [HSS-CITYU-2021-07]; Ideological and Political Education Projects of Shenzhen University [21MSZX08, Y20210607, 806-000031040202, 19XSZ03]",2021 Higher Education Fund of the Macao SAR Government; Ideological and Political Education Projects of Shenzhen University,This research was financially supported by the 2021 Higher Education Fund of the Macao SAR Government (grant number HSS-CITYU-2021-07) and the Ideological and Political Education Projects of Shenzhen University (grant number 21MSZX08; Y20210607; 806-000031040202; 19XSZ03).,,87,2,3,15,58,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Apart from empowering communities to make informed risk choices, risk information disclosure can also drastically enhance their disaster preparedness, especially concerning conjoint scenarios of technological and natural hazards (Natech). A fundamental precondition is the actual demand for such information. This study ventures to assess whether residents around Osaka Bay have this demand, or appetite, for risk information disclosure, as well as to understand their communicative behavior and perceived challenges in the Japanese context through the prism of the Situational Theory of Problem Solving. To test this framework under realistic conditions, data were collected through a household questionnaire survey from two urban areas near industrial complexes in Osaka Bay. The results show that identifying Natech risk information deficiency as a problem was not a statistically significant predictor for individuals' motivation to communicate. However, their motivation increased as their perceived personal involvement with the situation rose, while the perceived obstacles in doing something about it exerted a negative influence on their motivation. Individuals' motivation intensified their communicative actions to solve this problem. Public segmentation underscored the elevated public perceptions concerning the issue of risk information deficiency in nearly nine out of ten respondents. These findings indicate a strong community appetite for chemical and Natech risk information, which subsequently led to high situational motivation to engage in communicative action, particularly information acquisition. Risk management policy is suggested to focus on introducing chemical risk information disclosure regulatory initiatives to encourage citizen engagement.","[Tzioutzios, Dimitrios] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Urban Management, Kyoto 6158540, Japan; [Kim, Jeong-Nam] Univ Oklahoma, Gaylord Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Cruz, Ana Maria] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Kyoto 6110011, Japan",Kyoto University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Kyoto University,"Cruz, AM (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Kyoto 6110011, Japan.",cruznaranjo.anamaria.2u@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Tzioutzios, Dimitrios/GLQ-6573-2022; Kim, Jeong-Nam/KIC-4758-2024","Tzioutzios, Dimitrios/0000-0001-8557-8837; Kim, Jeong-Nam/0000-0002-4254-5784","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","This research was supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (Monbukagakusho: MEXT Scholarship, 2017-2019).",,67,4,4,6,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2095-0055,2192-6395,,INT J DISAST RISK SC,Int.

Answers to this question are vital and urgent, particularly in view of growing anti-Asian hate crimes amid the current pandemic. Motivated to address this question, we draw insights from the transactional model of stress and coping, the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS), and social media activism literature. We propose an integrative model that delineates the psychological antecedents and processes leading Asian Americans to cope with racial discrimination and engage in social media activism.

Design/methodology/approach A 2 (EVP type: skills-based vs. not-skills-based) x 2 (salience of corporate visual identity: high vs. low) randomized experiment was conducted with 157 participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. A fictitious company and its EVP messages were created to control for the company's existing reputation and participants' past experiences with the company. Findings Participants responded positively toward EVP messages regardless of the EVP type. However, salient corporate visual identity significantly aroused participants' more attributed firm-serving motives, which led to more negative attitudes toward the company. Next, issue involvement presented its value in EVP communication as highly involved participants displayed favorable attributions of EVPs and positive attitudes toward the company. Originality/value This study approaches EVPs as an important CSR practice and expands the discussion on strategic CSR communication by uncovering the roles of central and peripheral cues in public responses to EVP messages. Moreover, the findings highlight the importance of fostering and enhancing publics' issue involvement in achieving successful EVP communication.","[Shi, Duli] Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Shi, DL (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Commun, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",shiduli@umd.edu,,,,,,,68,2,2,1,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3289,1758-6046,,CORP COMMUN,Corp.

The results of this study showed that social media analytics is a valid tool to monitor how the spread of COVID-19 evolved from an issue to a crisis for the Trump administration. In addition, the federal government's lack of response and inability to handle the outbreak led to citizens' engagement and amplification of negative tweets that blamed the Trump White House.

Good organization-employee relationships encourage employees to seek and process information on social media. Organizations can obtain insights into maintaining favorable relationships with employees and improving their communication behaviors on social media. Social media has played an important role in facilitating employee communication behaviors. Based on an organization-public relationship model and the situational theory of publics, this study proposed and tested a model to examine the effect of symmetrical communication on employees' perceived relationships with their organization. It further investigated how organization-employee relationships affected employees' communication behaviors on social media. The researcher conducted a national survey of 449 employees working at large organizations in the United States and found that symmetrical communication had a positive effect on organization-employee relationships, which led employees to seek and process information on social media. Moreover, employees' position level in the organization negatively moderated the relationship between symmetrical communication and organization-employee relationships.

The variety of social classes and the increasing rate of foreigners, repatriates and students living in Japan defies this assumption. However, disaster preparedness and communication strategies tend to simplify the problem of multicultural communication in disaster as a purely linguistic issue. This research examines the assumption by Japanese policymakers and media that all residents in the Japanese archipelago are equally equipped with the cultural background and basic knowledge of the `average Japanese'. The research questions were: `how do foreign residents living in Japan perceive disaster preparedness and communication strategies?' and `what are the factors affecting their perceptions?'. Research findings suggest that the challenges faced by foreign residents go well beyond linguistic barriers and include cultural and social aspects that occur in their daily lives. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the perceived risks for foreign residents in Japan and suggests improvements in preparedness and communication strategies to minimise the vulnerabilities of communities in Japan.","[Petraroli, Irene; Baars, Roger C.] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan",Kyoto University,"Petraroli, I (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan.",,"Baars, Roger C./AEO-7780-2022","Baars, Roger C./0000-0002-3406-223X",,,,,25,0,0,0,2,AUSTRALIAN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT INST,EAST MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 1, 340 ALBERT ST, EAST MELBOURNE, VIC 3002, AUSTRALIA",1324-1540,,,AUST J EMERG MANAG,Aust.

We used social network analysis to segment publics based on their information sharing behaviors in the case of the Chinese #MeToo movement in 2018 on Sina Weibo. Besides, we conducted a content analysis to reveal the characteristics of each type of publics. We have identified three meaningful social-mediated publics in the Chinese #MeToo movement on Sina Weibo: (1) the provoking public, who plays an essential role in initiating the discussion; (2) the bridging public, which contributes to spreading the discussion to various groups of people; and (3) the powerful public, who has the advantages of the first two segments of publics and is the most powerful one in the formation and development of the online discussion. Three publics have different characteristics. The provoking public (e.g., media and internet celebrities) typically has many followers and is interested in various social issues. The bridging public has fewer followers (e.g., grassroots individuals) but tends to have a special interest in the issue and actively uses social media. The powerful public has a large number of followers, a particular interest in this issue, and is active on social media. This public segmentation provides a relatively new perspective to understand publics in digital activism in societies with strict social norms and media censorship.

Guided by the Situational Theory of Problem Solving (STOPS), the main goal of this experimental study is to understand the relationship between issue salience, issue proximity, communicative behavior for environmental issues, situation motivation for climate change, and environmental CSR (ECSR) supportive outcomes. This study used a U.S. sample (N = 440) recruited from a Qualtrics online panel and conducted a 2 (issue salience: salient vs. non-salient) x 2 (issue proximity: local vs. global) experimental design to examine the role of issue salience and issue proximity on individuals' environmentally friendly CSR outcomes. The structural equation model indicated that issue proximity has no significant impact, but issue salience impacted communicative behavior for environmental issues, which then predicted ECSR-supportive behavioral intentions. Importantly, most STOPS research has employed situational motivation as a mediator, but this study took a novel approach by assessing the impact of situational motivation as an independent variable on CAPS as well as environmental CSR outcomes. The results suggest that individuals with a higher motivation to solve the problem of climate change are not only likely to communicate about environmental issues (e.g., air pollution) with others but are also likely to support ECSR programs through positive word-of-mouth and higher purchase intentions. This study provides some noteworthy theoretical and practical contributions in the realm of ECSR communication by elucidating the impact of issue types and individuals' communicative behaviors in supporting a company's ECSR programs.","[Bhalla, Nandini] Texas State Univ, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Bhalla, N (corresponding author), Texas State Univ, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",nandinib@txstate.edu,,"Bhalla, Nandini/0000-0001-5984-6420",Pennsylvania State University [2018OC005]; University of South Carolina [15600-18-46768],Pennsylvania State University; University of South Carolina,This research is a part of a larger project funded from two sources: (a) the Arthur W.

However, there is a lack of literature reviews that focuses on the functions, effects, and implications of applying AI in the online higher education context. In addition, what AI algorithms are commonly used and how they influence online higher education remain unclear. To fill these gaps, this systematic review provides an overview of empirical research on the applications of AI in online higher education. Specifically, this literature review examines the functions of AI in empirical researches, the algorithms used in empirical researches and the effects and implications generated by empirical research. According to the screening criteria, out of the 434 initially identified articles for the period between 2011 and 2020, 32 articles are included for the final synthesis. Results find that: (1) the functions of AI applications in online higher education include prediction of learning status, performance or satisfaction, resource recommendation, automatic assessment, and improvement of learning experience; (2) traditional AI technologies are commonly adopted while more advanced techniques (e.g., genetic algorithm, deep learning) are rarely used yet; and (3) effects generated by AI applications include a high quality of AI-enabled prediction with multiple input variables, a high quality of AI-enabled recommendations based on student characteristics, an improvement of students' academic performance, and an improvement of online engagement and participation. This systematic review proposes the following theoretical, technological, and practical implications: (1) the integration of educational and learning theories into AI-enabled online learning; (2) the adoption of advanced AI technologies to collect and analyze real-time process data; and (3) the implementation of more empirical research to test actual effects of AI applications in online higher education.","[Ouyang, Fan; Zheng, Luyi] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Educ, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Pengcheng] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan 316021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Ouyang, F (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Educ, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",fanouyang@zju.edu.cn,"Jiao, Pengcheng/JWO-9851-2024; Jiao, Pengcheng/AAV-8337-2021; Ouyang, Fan/JHS-6065-2023; Ouyang, Fan/GQI-3203-2022; BUCCINI, FRANCESCA/HTM-4917-2023","Ouyang, Fan/0000-0002-4382-1381",National Natural Science Foundation of China [62177041],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 62177041.",,92,104,105,214,635,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1360-2357,1573-7608,,EDUC INF TECHNOL,Educ.

Through structure equation modeling of 418 survey responses, this study examines the relationship between the violation of Chinese consumers' expectations of CSA and the quality of consumer relationships through the mediation of violation valence, violation expectedness, and relationship certainty.","[Song, Baobao] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richard T Robertson Sch Media & Culture, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Lan, Xiaomeng] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Beijing Normal Univ, United Int Coll, Programme Publ Relat & Advertising, Zhuhai 519087, Peoples R China",Virginia Commonwealth University; Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College; Beijing Normal University; Hong Kong Baptist University,"Song, BB (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richard T Robertson Sch Media & Culture, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",bsong@vcu.edu; maggiexmlan@uic.edu.cn,"Lan, Xiaomeng/JCD-6170-2023","Lan, Xiaomeng/0000-0002-1969-7309",,,,,97,5,5,2,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,14,4,,,,,,,2385,10.3390/su14042385,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14042385,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZQ4TV,,gold,,,2024-08-19,WOS:000767100000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the theoretical framework of narrative transportation, the current study tests how exposure to employees' dissenting testimonials of the workplace might increase hypocrisy perception and negatively influence organizational reputation via the experience of transportation. A classic experiment design with a control group tests the between-subjects and within-subject effects of employees' dissenting voices on study variables. The results support the influences of employees' dissenting testimonials on transportation, perception of organizational hypocrisy, and damage to organizational reputation on both moral/affective and ability dimensions. Additionally, this study finds that the level of transportation differently influenced assessments of organizational reputation, suggesting a spillover effect on the ability dimension by moral transgressions.","[Kang, Minjeong] Indiana Univ Bloomington, Media Sch, 601 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Kang, M (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Bloomington, Media Sch, 601 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",kang60@indiana.edu,,"Kang, Minjeong/0000-0001-9988-283X",,,,,133,4,4,3,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1062-726X,1532-754X,,J PUBLIC RELAT RES,J.

Using the confirmation-bias theoretical model, this qualitative textual analysis examines the most widely circulated tweets of a fake-news item about Nike, 603 replies to the tweets, users' biographical profiles (e.g., political affiliations), the role of opinion leader(s), and relevant prior contexts. The findings provide in-depth insight into how people believe fake news and how their conversations about fake news (re)shape the victim brand's social realities. Overall, the findings of this study illustrate a Fake-News Network Model that explains the underlying mechanisms of how a fake-news item functions together with other aspects (e.g., context, perception, opinion leaders, and cognitive processes), prompting certain people to believe particular fake-news reports and, discuss the victim brand (e.g., Nike) based on that perceived truth.

Employees contribute to organizations by acting as brand ambassadors, boundary spanners and crisis communicators. Employees play such roles on top of assigned job tasks, which can lead to role overload, role conflicts and job stress. The analysis of employees' communication role enactment is hampered by the lack of a framework describing the complete range of active communication roles that employees are expected to play in the workplace. This article introduces the Active Employee Communication Roles (AECR) Framework (AECR), develops the conceptualization of eight communication roles, and discusses implications for strategic communication. The first four roles - the embodier, promotor, defender, and relationship builder role - describe ambassador roles. In addition, employees play the roles of scout, sensemaker, innovator, and critic to contribute to organizational development. The AECR framework provides a new lens which aids our understanding of the relationship between communication, and employee performance and wellbeing, and provides employees and employers a tool to analyze and calibrate mutual expectations regarding communication behaviors. The framework can also help employees to more strategically allocate resources when executing the various communication roles. This may help to alleviate employee role stress, and create healthier workplaces.","[Verhoeven, Joost W.

We first address criticisms of the two-way symmetrical communication model and Excellence theory in the field of public relations in order to highlight how concepts borrowed from negotiation and conflict management scholarship can remedy those concerns. Ultimately, we theorize an integrative public relations model that outlines a conflict-resolution perspective of public relations. Multiple scenarios and contexts in which this model might be applied include: contexts where high value is placed on long-term relationships; processes characterized by repeated, serial exchanges of information and communications between contending parties; conflict scenarios characterized by multiple issues entangled in strongly complex ways; situations where minimal power asymmetry exists between an organization and its publics; contexts characterized by openness to information sharing and exchange; and contexts where a high importance is placed on trust. Finally, a case illustrates how integrative public relations can be leveraged. We conclude with our model's implications for public relations and conflict management.","[Huang, Yi-Hui Christine; Cai, Qinxian] City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Cai, QX (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, 18 Tat Hong Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cenric97@gmail.com,"CAI, Qinxian/GGB-0600-2022; huang, yihui/JAN-8273-2023","CAI, Qinxian/0000-0001-7358-9416; Huang, Yi-Hui Christine/0000-0002-2621-9700",,,,,92,0,0,2,7,IACM-NCMR-INT ASSOC CONFLICT MANAGEMENT,JACKSONVILLE,"3355 BISHOP ESTATES RD, JACKSONVILLE, FL, UNITED STATES",1750-4708,1750-4716,,NEGOT CONFL MANAG R,Negot.

We examined 31,128 tweets with links to fake vs. true news by 20,179 users to identify 1,069 user clusters via clustering analysis. We tested whether attributes of authors (experience, followers, following, total tweets), time (date), or tweets (link to fake [vs. true] news, retweets) affected diffusion scope, speed, or shape, across user clusters via multilevel diffusion analysis. These tweets showed no overall diffusion pattern; instead, specific explanatory variables determined their scope, speed, and shape. Compared to true news tweets, fake news tweets started earlier and showed greater broadcast influence (greater diffusion speed), scope, and person-to-person influence. Authors with more experience and smaller user clusters both showed greater speed but less scope and less person-to-person influence. Likewise, later tweets showed slightly more broadcast influence, less scope, and more person-to-person influence. By contrast, users with more followers showed less broadcast influence but greater scope and slightly more person-to-person influence. These results highlight the earlier instances of fake news and the greater diffusion speed of fake news in smaller user clusters and by users with fewer followers, so they suggest that monitors can detect fake news earlier by focusing on earlier tweets, smaller user clusters, and users with fewer followers.","[Chiu, Ming Ming] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Analyt Assessment Res Ctr, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Park, Chong Hyun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Hyelim; Kim, Jeong-Nam] Univ Oklahoma, Gaylord Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Oh, Yu Won] Myongji Univ, Dept Digital Media, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jeong-Nam] Debiasing & Lay Informat, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Kim, Jeong-Nam] Univ Oklahoma, Data Inst Societal Challenges, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Myongji University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Kim, JN (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Gaylord Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Kim, JN (corresponding author), Debiasing & Lay Informat, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Kim, JN (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Data Inst Societal Challenges, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",layinformatics@gmail.com,"Kim, Jeong-Nam/KIC-4758-2024; Lee, Hyelim/ABV-7242-2022","Kim, Jeong-Nam/0000-0002-4254-5784; Lee, Hyelim/0000-0001-9032-9835; Chiu, Ming/0000-0002-5721-1971; Oh, Yu Won/0000-0001-6258-103X",Data Institute for Societal Challenges (DISC) at the University of Oklahoma,Data Institute for Societal Challenges (DISC) at the University of Oklahoma,We appreciate the statistics assistance of Yik Ting Choi.

A survey (N = 436) was conducted in the United States to test the construct reliability and validity of RAPIDS for three crises. The findings show conceptual and operational adequacy with an overarching latent construct (a second-order factor structure) encompassing all six principles.

Unfortunately, this evolution has not progressed as anticipated due to deficient comprehension of consumer cognition, evaluation, and receptiveness behaviors. Drawing on mainly Equity theory and the theory of Reasoned Action, this research proposes a three-level framework to investigate the focal forces and underlying processes related to consumer receptiveness of proximity BBT-based relationship programs. The data are collected in Taipei, Taiwan. The findings suggest the inhibiting and promoting roles of permission-triggered privacy concerns and social presence, respectively, in explaining variations in the consumer receptiveness of relationship programs. Moreover, innovation security, which includes perceived risk and technology anxiety, as well as frugality are confirmed to contribute to the increase in privacy concerns. Also, social presence is proven to mitigate the effect of innovation security on privacy concerns.","[Lin, Marta Yuan-Chen; Cheng, Julian Ming Sung] Natl Cent Univ, 300 Chung Da Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan; [Nguyen, Tessa Tien; Le, Angelina Nhat Hanh; Cheng, Julian Ming Sung] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City UEH, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Cheng, Edward Ying-Lun] UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",National Central University; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; University of London; University College London,"Cheng, JMS (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, 300 Chung Da Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.",kikilin2822@gmail.com; tessa.nguyen@isb.edu.vn; edtony55@gmail.com; hanhln@ueh.edu.vn; mingsungcheng@yahoo.com,"Nguyen, Tessa/KLC-6878-2024","Nguyen, Tessa Tien/0000-0001-6337-5836","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","This research is partly funded by University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",,101,4,4,10,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0148-2963,1873-7978,,J BUS RES,J.

Structural equation modeling results demonstrated that problem and involvement recognitions motivated people to communicate about the given issue, while constraint recognition decreased the motivation. SV was a strong driving force for people to actively communicate about a given issue; additionally, as a moderator, SV amplified the positive effect of involvement recognition on situational motivation and that of referent criterion on active communicative engagement. SV, however, was a negative predictor of participation intent in the environmental CSR campaign.

This study assessed the effect of a swap offer, Nutri-Score labeling, and a descriptive norm message on the nutrient profiling (NP) score of food choices in an online food basket. Additionally explored was whether these interventions made it more motivating and easier for consumers to select healthier foods and whether potential effects were moderated by consumer health interest. Methods: Hypotheses were tested with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a simulated online supermarket. Dutch participants (n = 550) chose their preferred product out of six product options for four different categories (breakfast cereals, crackers, pizza, and muesli bars). Participants were randomly allocated to one of eight groups based on the interventions in a 2 (Nutri-Score: present, not present) X 2 (swap offer: present, not present) X 2 (norm message: present, not present) between subject design. The primary outcome was the difference in combined NP score of product choices, for which a lower score represented a healthier product. Results: Swap offer (B = - 9.58, 95% CI: [- 12.026; - 7.132], eta(2) = 0.098) and Nutri-Score labeling (B = - 3.28, 95% CI: [- 5.724; -.829], eta(2) = 0.013) significantly improved the combined NP score compared to the control condition (NP score M = 18.03, SD = 14.02), whereas a norm message did not have a significant effect (B = - 1.378, 95% CI [- 3.825; 1.070], eta(2) = 0.002). No evidence was found that interventions made it more motivating or easier for consumers to select healthier food, but situational motivation significantly influenced the healthiness score of food choices for both swap offer (b = - 3.40, p < .001) and Nutri-Score (b = - 3.25, p < .001). Consumer health interest only significantly moderated the influence of Nutri-Score on ease of identifying the healthy food option (b = .23, p = .04).

To make cross-cultural comparisons, we conducted a multi-country survey early in the pandemic in South Korea, the United States (US) and Singapore. The results suggest that trust was negatively related to fear, anger, sadness and anxiety, and positively related to hope. These emotions were significant mediators of the effect of trust on information seeking and avoidance, except for anger on avoidance. Importantly, the indirect effects of trust in government varied by country. Fear was a stronger mediator between trust and information seeking in South Korea than in the US. In contrast, sadness and anger played more prominent mediating roles in Singapore than in South Korea. This study offers theoretical insights into better understanding the roles of discrete emotions in forming information behaviors.

Data were collected through three surveys that spanned from February to April, 2020. Results indicate that people seek and share information mostly to fulfill social expectations regarding their own knowledge of the pandemic. Individuals who perceive information about the pandemic on social media as credible are more likely to share information. Those who view themselves as capable to gather information are more likely to seek information, but this perceived ability is related to information sharing only as the pandemic becomes more pertinent to Americans. Consistent with past research, people with higher risk perception report stronger affective response to the pandemic, which increases their information insufficiency.

We argue that bias persists because although many White Americans espouse nonracist beliefs, far fewer actively work to combat the societal and institutional discrimination that impedes social change. In the current work, we were interested in identifying and measuring the belief systems associated with White Americans' active participation in the fight against racial discrimination. In six studies, we developed and validated a measure of antiracism to tap into the belief that White people should proactively fight racial discrimination. Results established the convergent and discriminant validity of the measure and confirmed that antiracism was related to, but distinct from, personal nonracist beliefs. Moreover, higher levels of antiracism were associated with greater perceptions of racial discrimination, collective action intentions, willingness to condemn an officer in a racially motivated shooting, support for diversity tax incentives, and likelihood of signing up to receive information about volunteering for an equal rights organization. Results suggest antiracist beliefs may be the key to understanding White Americans' active support for social change.","[LaCosse, Jennifer] Bates Coll, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA; [Krusemark, Danielle; Foltz, Jennifer; Plant, E.

Design/methodology/approach This study used secondary data from the 2016 Korea Media Panel Survey conducted with 8,439 Korean adults. Findings The results indicated that political participation is generally associated with the use of online news forums, online communities, online services and online information production, but not with the use of social networking sites (SNSs). Additional analyses revealed that the use of different Internet modes has an indirect effect on voting intention through political information seeking. The analysis also showed that a number of sociodemographic characteristics influence political participation. Originality/value As one of the first studies to focus on active information behaviors in examining the influence of Internet use, this study enhances the understanding of how human behaviors are shaped by digital technology. By providing guidelines for the use of different modes of the Internet, the findings of this study also have practical implications for efforts to encourage political participation.","[Kim, Jarim] Yonsei Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Yesolran] Kookmin Univ, Sch Commun, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University; Kookmin University,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Kookmin Univ, Sch Commun, Seoul, South Korea.",kimysr@kookmin.ac.kr,,"Kim, Yesolran/0000-0001-8026-8485; Kim, Jarim/0000-0002-2973-9656",Yonsei University [2021-22-0225],Yonsei University,This work was supported by the Yonsei University Research Grant of 2021 (#2021-22-0225).,,76,2,2,4,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1468-4527,1468-4535,,ONLINE INFORM REV,Online Inf.

Moreover, this study hypothesized that Chinese immigrants who are more acculturated would perceive relatively less social stigma toward mental illness. Results from a nationwide survey of 421 Chinese immigrants in the United States provided empirical support for the important roles of acculturation and social stigma in influencing Chinese immigrants' communicative action and behavioral intentions regarding mental illness and mental health services. The findings offered theoretical and practical implications. Interventions and education programs that target stigma tolerance and cultural competency may be appropriate to reduce social stigma among Chinese immigrants. Increased opportunities to engage in dialogues regarding mental illness may also be key in reducing stigma and increasing the likelihood to seek professional help.","[Li, Jo-Yun] Univ Miami, Dept Strateg Commun, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA",University of Miami,"Li, JY (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Dept Strateg Commun, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.",queenie.li@miami.edu,,"Li, Jo-Yun/0000-0003-0245-7306",,,,,62,6,7,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1553-118X,1553-1198,,INT J STRATEG COMMUN,Int.

It classifies the concept into three culturally relevant dimensions-public expectations of (a) organizational accommodative responses (i.e., how an in-crisis organization should respond), (b) punishment of the organization (i.e., how publics collectively should respond), and (c) government intervention (i.e., how government should respond) for desirable crisis outcomes. Using an online survey of the Beijing public, this study investigates the degree to which information seeking and online expression mediate relationships between crisis blame and the three types of expectations. The study finds that as the level of crisis blame increases, active information seekers expect more regarding organizational accommodation and government intervention, whereas active expressers expect stronger punishments of the organization and less government intervention in China.","[Ji, Yingru] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Kim, Sora] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Shatin, 307 Humanities Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Shatin, 307 Humanities Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yingru.ji@gmail.com; sorakim@cuhk.edu.hk,"Kim, Sora/G-9008-2018; Kim, Sora/HZK-4185-2023","Kim, Sora/0000-0003-0557-6538; Ji, Yingru/0000-0003-2969-2947",,,,,84,1,1,2,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

The causal chains of the IPI hypothesis were examined using an experimental methodology with a HIV prevention, PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). The results supported the expectations. Presumed exposure to health messages about PrEP shaped presumed influence of the messages on others, which in turn affected one's own intentions for information seeking and prosocial behaviors about PrEP. The findings also show that descriptive norms and injunctive norms interact with presumed influence differently.

This refers to the rapid spread of (accurate and false) information, mainly through internet usage increasing. Digital health literacy (DHL) is therefore important for addressing challenges related to online health information and services, as well as for navigation through the complex information landscape with huge amounts of different (and conflicting) information about COVID-19. The aim of this study is to examine the level of DHL in relation to COVID-19 in Slovenian university students and to determine online information-seeking behaviour in order to plan and prepare effective communication interventions for this sub-population. A cross-sectional survey, administered by an online questionnaire, was conducted to collect data on DHL. A total of 3621 students participated, of whom 70% were female and the average age was 22.65 years (SD = 4.65). Bivariate analyses were performed to assess the association of key characteristics with DHL. Overall, the results show that the level of DHL among students is sufficient. Most difficulties were reported in assessing the reliability of information (n = 1484, 49.3%). Approximately one third of the students (n = 847, 27.9%) reported having problems in finding information of their interest, and somewhat more (n = 900, 29.6%) reported difficulties in making a selection among all the information found. Students with a sufficient level of DHL are more likely to seek information through search engines and websites of official institutions, while students with a limited level of DHL more frequently reported using social media for health information searches. It is necessary to establish interventions for a systematic lift of the DHL and health literacy (HL) of all population groups.","[Vrdelja, Mitja; Vrbovsek, Sanja; Klopcic, Vito] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Trubarjeva 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Dadaczynski, Kevin] Fulda Univ Appl Sci, Dept Nursing & Hlth Sci, D-36037 Fulda, Germany; [Dadaczynski, Kevin] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Ctr Appl Hlth Sci, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Okan, Orkan] Bielefeld Univ, Fac Educ Sci, Interdisciplinary Ctr Hlth Literacy Res, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Bielefeld,"Vrdelja, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Trubarjeva 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",mitja.vrdelja@nijz.si; sanja.vrbovsek@nijz.si; vito.klopcic@nijz.si; kevin.dadaczynski@pg.hs-fulda.de; orkan.okan@uni-bielefeld.de,"Okan, Orkan/GPT-4707-2022","Okan, Orkan/0000-0003-1714-4783; Dadaczynski, Kevin/0000-0002-7367-5362",European Union from the European Social Fund; Republic of Slovenia,European Union from the European Social Fund; Republic of Slovenia,"The study presented in this article is part of the project Raising Health Literacy in Slovenia, implemented by the National Institute of Public Health and the Ministry of Health within the Operational Programme for the Implementation of EU Cohesion Policy in the 2014-2020 programming period.

While political fans are important stakeholders of political organizations and political figures, little is known about who political fans are and how they participate in political activities. To address this gap, the differences between political fans and enthusiastic partisans are explained using six dimensions, namely, worship, identification, loyalty, playing, investment, and fan community engagement. Building on these dimensions, this study examined the impact of perceived charms of a political figure on political fans by surveying Korean participants. This study further explored political fans' tendency to participate in politics as well as information seeking and sharing.

The present study aims to help move the research in public diplomacy forward and contribute to empirical and theoretical understanding of temporary migrants (TMs) as a subgroup of WBFPs by examining how they communicate about their host region with their personal networks from home. Using semi-structured interviews with 17 TMs in Macao, this study examines their megaphoning characteristics and two-way communication patterns with their personal networks in their home regions. TMs communicated about Macao based on their firsthand experiences, providing evidence of megaphoning. The communicated content consisted mainly of cultural and life-based topics, including both positive tones and negative problem sharing of issues they immediately encountered in their life in the host region. Two-way rather than one-way communication was found, which reflected TMs' willingness to adjust their communication pattern after understanding the awareness level and the interest of their communication counterparts. Furthermore, TMs' twoway communication facilitated the correction and expansion of information their personal networks held about Macao. The present study helps build understanding of the communication behaviors of TMs and their roles as microboundary spanners in public diplomacy.","[Choi, Suh-hee] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Geog, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Vibber, Kelly] Univ Dayton, Dept Commun, 300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45469 USA; [Kim, Jeong-Nam] Univ Oklahoma, Gaylord Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Gaylord Family Endowed Chair Strateg Commun, 395 W Lindsey St, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Kyung Hee University; University System of Ohio; University of Dayton; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Choi, SH (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Geog, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",suhhee@khu.ac.kr; kvibber1@udayton.edu; Layinformatics@gmail.com,"Choi, Suh-hee/AAD-1655-2020; Kim, Jeong-Nam/KIC-4758-2024","Choi, Suh-hee/0000-0002-4711-7383; Kim, Jeong-Nam/0000-0002-4254-5784",,,,,52,1,2,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

It is rarely tailored to the specific domains of functioning in which it is applied and is generically operationalized with items measuring whether one can perform an action in terms of ability, confidence, and knowledge. Despite the predictive power of such an all-purpose measure, the construct's operational power lies in its ability to identify the experiential sources from which self-efficacy is derived and in providing guidelines to structure experiences to enable the desired behavioral changes. To demonstrate the construct's operational power in a specific research domain within public relations, this study revisits Bandura's (1977) original publication on self-efficacy to explain how to reconceptualize the construct for a specific research problem within public diplomacy: how sojourners-experiential relationship holders with a host region-develop self-efficacy to proactively forward information and make a positive recommendation about their host region. Results from a survey (N = 320) conducted among sojourners living in Macao found that the tailored construct with four experiential sources explains two communicative behaviors: proactive forwarding of information about a sojourner's host region and persuading others to work or study in their host region. The process of reconceptualizing self-efficacy to enhance its operational power in examining specific research domains within public relations is discussed.","[Tam, Lisa] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Choi, Suh-hee] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Geog, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Kim, Jeong-Nam] Univ Oklahoma, Gaylord Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, 395 W Lindsey St, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Kyung Hee University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Choi, SH (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Geog, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",l.tam@qut.edu.au; suhhee@khu.ac.kr; Layinformatics@gmail.com,"Tam, Lisa/I-6237-2019; Kim, Jeong-Nam/KIC-4758-2024; Choi, Suh-hee/AAD-1655-2020","Tam, Lisa/0000-0001-6520-6120; Kim, Jeong-Nam/0000-0002-4254-5784; Choi, Suh-hee/0000-0002-4711-7383",,,,,79,3,4,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

The findings demonstrated the important mediating role of situational motivation in problem solving on a given environmental issue between skepticism/cynicism and megaphoning effects. Using a nationwide survey of 504 participants living in the United States, this study found that skepticism and cynicism increased the negative megaphoning effect and decreased positive megaphoning behaviors. Furthermore, skepticism/cynicism and megaphoning behaviors were partially mediated by situational motivation in problem solving. In particular, skeptics who were motivated to solve an environmental issue were less likely to take and forward negative information about a corporation in an environmental CSR activity. This study provides new theoretical and practical insights into CSR strategies that address skepticism and cynicism in publics and their resulting communicative behaviors.","[Chon, Myoung-Gi] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, 237 Tichenor Hall, Auburn, AL 36830 USA; [Kim, Young] Marquette Univ, J William & Mary Diederich Coll Commun, Johnston Hall 423, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Marquette University,"Chon, MG (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, 237 Tichenor Hall, Auburn, AL 36830 USA.",mzc0113@auburn.edu; Young.kim@marquette.edu,"Kim, Young/Q-5459-2019","Chon, Myoung-Gi/0000-0002-6586-6863",School of Communication and Jour-nalism at Auburn University,School of Communication and Jour-nalism at Auburn University,This study was funded by the School of Communication and Jour-nalism at Auburn University (Sarah Bronczek Award) .,,81,10,11,5,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Design/methodology/approach Survey data (N = 476) were collected from US citizens, who self-identified as full-time employees, through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in August 2020. Findings Organizational conflict history (i.e. highly conflict-prone vs less conflict-prone workplaces) interacts with employees' situational perceptions of COVID-19 (i.e. inactive vs active publics) in affecting employees' negative megaphoning and turnover intention toward their organizations. Employees who are active publics on COVID-19 in highly conflict-prone workplaces reported the highest negative megaphoning and turnover intention. On the contrary, employees who are inactive publics on COVID-19 in less conflict-prone workplaces reported the lowest negative megaphoning and turnover intention. Practical implications COVID-19 is an uncontrollable, exogenous crisis for organizations. While it is expected that employees in highly conflict-prone workplaces would report higher negative megaphoning and turnover intention, this study found that employees' situational perceptions of COVID-19 would further exacerbate the effects. This finding reflects the importance of managing organizational conflicts continuously and preemptively while also segmenting and cultivating relationships with employees based on their situational perceptions of issues and crises. Originality/value This study identified the significance of the interaction of cross-situational factors (e.g. employees' recollection of organizational conflict history) and situational factors (e.g. employees' situational perceptions of issues) in affecting employees' negative behavioral intentions in crisis situations, even if the crises are exogenous and uncontrollable.","[Chon, Myoung-Gi] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Tam, Lisa] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kim, Jeong-Nam] Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Tam, L (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",mzc0113@auburn.edu; l.tam@qut.edu.au; layinformatics@gmail.com,"Tam, Lisa/I-6237-2019; Kim, Jeong-Nam/KIC-4758-2024","Tam, Lisa/0000-0001-6520-6120; Kim, Jeong-Nam/0000-0002-4254-5784; Chon, Myoung-Gi/0000-0002-6586-6863","School of Communication and Journalism at Auburn University, USA","School of Communication and Journalism at Auburn University, USA","This study was funded by an internal grant from the School of Communication and Journalism at Auburn University, USA.",,68,8,9,2,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1363-254X,1478-0852,,J COMMUN MANAG,J.

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ease of access and transmission of information via social media has led to ambiguity, misinformation and uncertainty. This research studies the aforementioned behaviours of information sharing and verification related to COVID-19, in the context of social media. Design/methodology/approach - Two studies have been carried out. Study 1, with Indian social media users, is a two-factor between-subjects experimental design that investigated the effect of message polarity (positive versus negative) and message type (news versus rumour) on the dissemination and verification behaviour of COVID-19-related messages. The study also investigated the mediation of perceived message importance and health anxiety. Study 2 is a replica study conducted with US users. Findings - The study finding revealed significantly higher message sharing for news than rumour. Further, for the Indian users, message with positive polarity led to higher message sharing and message with negative polarity led to higher verification behaviour. On the contrary, for the US users, message with negative polarity led to higher message sharing and message with positive polarity led to higher verification behaviour. Finally, the study revealed message importance mediates the relationship of message type and message sharing behaviour for Indian and US users; however, health anxiety mediation was significant only for Indian users. Practical implications - The findings offer important implications related to information regulation during a health crisis. Unverified information sharing is harmful during a pandemic. The study sheds light on this behaviour such that stakeholders get insights and better manage the information being disseminated. Originality/value - The study investigates the behaviour of sharing and verification of social media messages between users containing health information (news and rumour) related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","[Sharma, Anumegha] FORE Sch Management, New Delhi, India; [Kapoor, Payal S.] FORE Sch Management, Mkt, New Delhi, India",FORE School of Management; FORE School of Management,"Kapoor, PS (corresponding author), FORE Sch Management, Mkt, New Delhi, India.",sharma.anumegha@gmail.com; payal@fsm.ac.in,,,"FORE School of Management, New Delhi","FORE School of Management, New Delhi","The infrastructural support provided by FORE School of Management, New Delhi, to Dr Payal S.

Understanding what factors influence people's health decision-making process is essential for not only the design of the OHC, but also for commercial health business who are promoting their products to patients. Previous studies explored the health decision-making process from many factors, but lacked a comprehensive model with a theoretical model. The aim of this paper is to propose a research model from the situational theory of problem solving in relation to forecasting health behaviors in OHCs. An online questionnaire was developed to collect data from 321 members of online health communities (HPV Tieba and HPV vaccina Tieba) who have not received an HPV vaccination. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method was employed for the data analysis. Findings showed that information selection and acquisition is able to forecast HPV vaccination intentions, perceived seriousness and perceived susceptibility can directly impact HPV vaccination intention and have an indirect impact by information selection and acquisition, and perceived message credibility indirectly affected HPV vaccination intention via information selection. The current paper supports health motivations analysis in OHCs, with potential to assist users' health-related decision-making.","[Xu, Xiaoting] Nanjing Univ, Sch Informat Management, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Li, Honglei; Shan, Shan] Northumbria Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",Nanjing University; Northumbria University,"Li, HL (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",xxt9337@163.com; Honglei.Li@northumbria.ac.uk; shan.shan@northumbria.ac.uk,"shan, shan/JJE-3718-2023; shan, shan/JUU-8486-2023; Li, Honglei/M-9132-2014","SHAN, SHAN/0000-0003-4928-588X; Li, Honglei/0000-0003-3126-0764","Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Chinese Ministry of Education, under the key project The Research on Smart Senior Care Service [19JZD021]","Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Chinese Ministry of Education, under the key project The Research on Smart Senior Care Service","This research was funded by Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Chinese Ministry of Education, under the key project The Research on Smart Senior Care Service, grant number 19JZD021.",,86,12,14,15,99,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

A survey of 627 South Korean adults was conducted in March 2020, when the country experienced an early but rapidly accelerating pandemic stage. The results of structural equation modeling demonstrated that in addition to confirming the major propositions of STOPS, three situational perception variables (i.e., problem recognition, involvement recognition, and constraint recognition) were highly associated with an individual's fear and anger regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. However, only fear significantly affected situational motivation in problem-solving and information behaviors (i.e., information-seeking, forwarding, and permitting).

To fill the gap, this study tested how crisis type and ad identification influence the effectiveness of native CSR advertising as a post-crisis response strategy. An online experiment was conducted using a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. The results indicated that perceived manipulativeness was the underlying mechanism of how ad identification impaired consumer responses. Crisis type affected advertising effectiveness through consumers' attributions of crisis responsibility and values-driven CSR motive. More importantly, ad identification significantly impaired consumers' attitudes toward a native CSR advertisement and their intention to share the advertisement in the victim crisis condition, but not in the accidental or intentional crisis condition. These findings provide meaningful contributions to both the research and practice of CSR advertising.","[Wu, Linwan; Overton, Holly] Univ South Carolina, Coll Informat & Commun, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 800 Sumter St,Room 328, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Wu, LW (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Coll Informat & Commun, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, 800 Sumter St,Room 328, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",linwanwu@mailbox.sc.edu,,"Overton, Holly/0000-0003-1980-8512; Wu, Linwan/0000-0002-5294-3559",Page Legacy Scholar Grant [2018OC002]; Arthur W.

However, it is less well understood how the quality of the relationship between government and various publics may impact long-term disaster-coping and recovery outcomes. Extending the relationship management framework to the context of disaster management, the current study tests the relationships among different ethnic publics' OPR quality, their communicative behaviors of seeking government and EM information, and disastercoping outcomes. Results suggest that government OPR quality is positively related to information seeking and major disaster-coping outcomes, including self-efficacy, collective efficacy, and community resilience perceptions. Moreover, the extent to which OPR quality impacts disaster-coping outcomes significantly diverges across ethnic lines. Results provide implications for multicultural relationship management in the context of postdisaster recovery and community building.","[Liu, Wenlin; Ni, Lan] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, 3347 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Liu, WL (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, 3347 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",wliu30@central.uh.edu,,"Ni, Lan/0000-0003-3012-4402",Emerging Scholar Grant from the AEJMC,Emerging Scholar Grant from the AEJMC,The study acknowledges financial support from the Emerging Scholar Grant from the AEJMC.,,91,24,25,6,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

However, in recent years, there has been a decline in the number of Australians choosing to purchase private health insurance (PHI), particularly within the young adult age group with the proportion of insurance customers aged 20 to 29 falling from 10.3 to 9.4% between 2012 and 2017 (Sivey, The Conversation, 2017). Young adults are critical to private health insurance funding models as their involvement offsets the drawdown by older adults (Dalzell and Borys, ABC News, 2019). While this issue is widely reported in the Australian media, few empirical studies have explored the factors that enable or constrain young adults' enrolment in PHI.MethodsTo address the scarcity of research about the motivational factors behind young adult decision-making, this study conducted a survey of 594 Australian young adults aged between 18 and 30years. Within this age group, the survey sought an equal split of participants who were members and non-members of PHI schemes.ConclusionThe findings identified perceived value and trust in insurers as additional motivational factors alongside traditional measures of recognition of the problem and involvement in the problem. Differences between the insured and uninsured groups were identified which help to shape a more holistic understanding of the key motivational factors and barriers in relation to Australian young adults' enrolment in PHI.","[Tam, Lisa; Tyquin, Ellen; Mehta, Amisha] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Larkin, Ingrid] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Tam, L (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",l.tam@qut.edu.au,"Tyquin, Ellen/AAQ-8993-2021; Tam, Lisa/I-6237-2019","Tam, Lisa/0000-0001-6520-6120; Tyquin, Ellen/0000-0002-9083-3764",,,,,45,4,4,1,9,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1472-6963,,BMC HEALTH SERV RES,BMC Health Serv.

In terms of methodology, a questionnaire was carried out to measure breast cancer publics' communicative behavior in Turkey by eventually obtaining data for 500 valid and complete questionnaires. A cluster analysis identified three breast cancer public types to exist in Turkey: Indifferent (n = 191), Conscientious (n = 144), and Moderate (n = 159). As a result, combining STP with TRA was found to be a valid model in segmenting breast cancer publics in Turkey.

The results show that: (1) Failed scenic services, mismatches between expectations and the scenic environment, not being treated fairly by scenic employees, and other reasons are the main motives that cause tourists to complain online. (2) Tourists' complaints about scenic spots are mainly concentrated in five areas: Crowded, tourism attraction, service, tickets, management and others. The complaints of tourists from different scenic spots are slightly different. (3) Tourists of different nationalities have different incomes and cultural backgrounds, which lead to different complaints about the scenic spots. The research results of this article are conducive to the managers of scenic spots to understand the content of tourists' complaints and the reasons of tourists' complaining behaviors, and it is conducive to the smooth implementation of the remedial measures after the event by enterprises, thereby enhancing the satisfaction of tourists.","[Duan, Zhaowen; Zhang, Tingwei; Jiang, Rui; Xie, Shan; Sun, Hanyu] Xian Int Studies Univ, Sch Tourism, Xian 710128, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an International Studies University,"Duan, ZW (corresponding author), Xian Int Studies Univ, Sch Tourism, Xian 710128, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",415844482@qq.com,"xie, shan/HIZ-6686-2022",,Xi'an International Studies University [SYJS201829],Xi'an International Studies University,"DI am very grateful to Mr. Duan Zhaowen for his guidance, and Jiang Rui and Xie Shan for their help.

As one of the initial efforts in building a theory of CSA in public relations scholarship, the model segments consumers based on three outcome variables - boycott intention, purchase intention, and corporate reputation. This model also incorporates consumer-company congruence, company-cause fit, consumer-cause fit, and issue involvement as antecedent variables. A survey of 482 adult consumers found that consumer-company congruence and company-cause fit had significant negative impacts on boycott intention, but positive influences on purchase intention. Consumer-company congruence, company-cause fit, and consumer-cause fit all had significant positive impacts on corporate reputation. Moreover, interaction effects between company-cause fit and consumers' involvement with the specific CSA issue were found significant on both boycott intention and purchase intention.

The goals of this study are to (1) determine how donor experience affects organization-public relationships (OPRs) and its antecedents for these two groups and (2) extend the OPR model by considering new potential supportive behavioral intentions arising from OPR outcomes. Design/methodology/approach Using data from a survey of self-identified donors and donor-volunteers, multiple regressions were performed to establish the possible effects of experience and advocacy on OPRs. Findings Findings of this study support the idea that donation experience can be considered a potential antecedent for the OPR. The findings also support the idea that advocacy can be a valuable behavioral outcome resulting from OPR. Practical implications Nonprofits are ever seeking to better connect with their donor and volunteer supporters. This study helps to show the value of donation experience and the importance of cultivating advocacy behaviors among these supporters. Originality/value The study seeks to merge extant theory in communications and public policy to better understand the OPR model. Specifically, connecting OPR to the antecedent of donor experience and behavioral intentions like advocacy will help paint a stronger picture of donor-volunteer relationships with nonprofits.","[Harrison, Virginia] Clemson Univ, Dept Commun, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Buckley, Christen] Penn State Univ, Bellisario Coll Commun, State Coll, PA USA; [Xiao, Anli] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",Clemson University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Harrison, V (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Commun, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",virginia.s.harrison@gmail.com; clb5344@psu.edu; axiao@mailbox.sc.edu,,,Arthur W.

Specifically, it investigates how employee post characteristics including valence and content and employer reputation jointly influence publics' online and offline behaviors. Design/methodology/approach A 2 (post valence: positive vs. negative) x 2 (post content: organization-related vs. job-related) x 2 (employer reputation: good vs. bad) between-subjects experiment was conducted. Participants were asked to view a stimulus social media post created by a fictitious company employee, reflecting one of the eight experimental conditions on a random basis. After viewing, they were requested to report their online engagement intentions (i.e., like, share and comment) with the post and offline WOM intentions about the company. Findings The experimental results showed that participants expressed more like intentions when they viewed a positive post than a negative post. Further, they were more likely to comment on a job-related post as opposed to an organization-related post. In addition, a significant interaction effect between post valence and employer reputation on publics' online engagement was found, which in turn influenced their offline WOM intentions about the company. Originality/value This study is among the first empirical attempts to examine the effectiveness of employees' personal social media posts on external publics' online and offline behaviors.

Through digital media, they can provide information about a crisis, criticize crisis participants or defend the organization experiencing the crisis (Coombs & Holladay, 2014). Limited research exists on the active role of publics in defending the organization. A handful of studies have looked at crisis communication of active organization supporters, including faith-holders (Luoma-aho, 2015); however there is a limited amount of public relations scholarship about the nature of faithholders, their communication under crisis circumstances, and whether they in fact attempt to help organizations in times of crisis. By using a combination of content analysis and rhetorical analysis, this paper examined the crisis communication strategies offered by the organization's faith-holders in the comments to the crisis-related articles published on the websites of media outlets. Through a case study of Tesla Motors' crisis, the paper determined that faith-holders are a powerful force in defending the organization during the crisis, using both traditional reputation repair strategies identified by Coombs (2015) as well as new strategies identified by the study. Faith-holders were not a monolithic group and differed in terms of what aspects of the organization they had faith. Their communication was not restricted by legal and ethical demands. The results provide insights into understanding of faith-holders' communication during crises, and also highlight the need for reconsidering the situational crisis communication theory in respect to organizations' faith-holders.","[Kochigina, Anna] Univ Tennessee, Commun 476, 1345 Circle Pk Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Kochigina, A (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Commun 476, 1345 Circle Pk Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",akochi@vols.utk.edu,,"Kochigina, Anna/0000-0003-3091-5589",,,,,71,4,4,5,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Through qualitative and quantitative inquiry, the authors employ the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS) to disentangle active and passive communicative action in a model that predicts three common supportive prosocial behaviors-financial support, volunteerism, and political support. Findings demonstrate an asymmetry between passive and active communicative actions, both with respect to antecedents and the strength with which they predict prosocial behavioral support. While both situational motivation and referent criterion predict active communicative action; only situational motivation predicts passive communicative action. Further, in this context, passive communicative action is the best predictor of common support behaviors including donating money, volunteering time and participating in policy advocacy.

Design/methodology/approach Data are collected from 196 respondents using a scenario-based survey. Proposed model is tested using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings It is found that individual's moral identity and issue involvement influence perceived civility of the online post, which in turn affects attitude toward the party as well as the individual. It is observed that for high partisans, effect of perceived civility on attitude toward the party is stronger compared to low partisans. Party's lack of responsiveness to address the uncivil comment from its representative increases party's incivility accountability and lowers the partisan attitude toward the party. Originality/value The study presents a novel understanding of how political party representatives can influence the image of the party by engaging in an uncivil discourse on social media. Results support that strong partisan would react more unfavorably indicating that loyalty toward the party cannot be taken for granted.

Via integrating literature from multi-disciplines such as crisis management, mental health and digital communication, this quantitative study intends to contribute to close this gap and explore the associations between perceived gratifications and protection motivations of using mental health chatbot services, active communicative action, and online and offline engagement behaviours of solving mental health problems after disasters. This study surveyed 1,114 US participants who ever used chatbot services from top healthcare companies. Implications of the results enhance theoretical discussions on how artificial intelligence has shaped individuals' motivations, communicative action and engagement behaviour to treat mental health problems.

In addition, boycotters in Budweiser and Starbucks networks were engaged in boycotting other brands or organizations which were opposed to Republicans or President Trump's policy. Finally, the network of boycotters was very dense and highly connected among subgroups while that of advocators was sparse.

To identify major determinants of why individuals seek health information online, we conducted a meta-analysis that systematically accumulates the existing research findings. To that end, by integrating three theories or models for examining information-seeking behavior, we developed a theoretical framework for the current meta-analysis that emphasizing psychosocial, instrumental, contextual, and demographic factors. By analyzing the effect sizes from 44 articles representing 54 empirical samples, we found that the quality, trustworthiness, and utility of online health information were the dominant predictors of seeking it and that instrumental factors were more important than psychological ones in determining whether individuals did so. Moreover, the development of information and communication technology, the sampling method, and the type of information sought significantly moderated pairwise relationships between determinants and seeking behavior, whereas culture did not.

Given that the importance of the role of public segmentation is well documented in both public relations and environmental management literatures, the present study attempts to fill the gap by exploring whether consumers can be segmented on the basis of attitudinal factors, and, if so, how this segmentation informs communication efforts aimed at promoting companies' environmental CSR programs. Design/methodology/approach This segmentation approach is examined based on a survey of 470 participants. Results of a k-means cluster analysis identified three subgroups: active publics, aware publics and latent publics. Findings Survey results provide empirical support evidence on how different public segmentation approaches can be used to predict individual communication behaviors on environmental CSR issues. Segmentation approach that considered individuals' attitudes on environmental issues and their perceptions on company environmental CSR practices helps identify three subgroups. Significant differences regarding communicative action and supporting behaviors among the three groups are identified and discussed. Originality/value This study provides key insights about public segmentation and different publics' communicative action, and supportive behaviors provide direction for future research investigations that will strengthen theoretical arguments and best practices in public relations.","[Li, Jo-Yun] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Overton, Holly] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Bhalla, Nandini] Washington & Lee Univ, Lexington, VA 24450 USA",University of Miami; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Washington & Lee University,"Li, JY (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",queenie.li@miami.edu,,"Li, Jo-Yun/0000-0003-0245-7306; Overton, Holly/0000-0003-1980-8512",,,,,61,10,10,1,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3289,1758-6046,,CORP COMMUN,Corp.

Grounded in the situational theory of problem solving, this study investigated who engages in instant activism and what their behavioral consequences are. Results of an online survey (n = 483) suggested that (a) individuals with a low level of issue knowledge but a high level of issue involvement tend to believe a social media hoax and (b) belief in the hoax leads individuals to engage in active communicative activities that involve problem solving and behavioral changes when mediated by situational motivation.

The unique characteristics of politicized consumer activism (i.e., consumers acting for political rather than economic reasons and being driven by a political stance rather than morality or identity) render it distinct from other frameworks, such as self-interest-motivated consumer activism, political consumer activism, and consumer nationalism. To shed light on the participants involved in politicized consumer activism, the present study includes a public segmentation analysis of a case in a Chinese context. Building on the situational theory of publics (STP), this study incorporates three objective resources-economic, social, and cultural capital-as segmenting criteria. Data were collected by sending out self-administered questionnaires, resulting in 450 valid and complete questionnaires. A two-step cluster analysis identified three segments: the inactive unprivileged group (cluster 1), the moderate elites (cluster 2), and the active middle class (cluster 3). The degree of activism was lowest in cluster 1 and highest in cluster 3.

An online experiment among 221 general consumers in the United States was conducted. The results demonstrated that negative messages regarding CSR distributed by employees in face-to-face communication decreased publics' favorable attitudes and behavioral intentions to a greater extent than that distributed via social media (i.e., Facebook). However, the effect of communication channel became insignificant when positive messages regarding CSR were shared by employees. The results further showed that perceived authenticity mediated the effects of channel and message valence on publics' attitudes and behavioral intentions.

When many others add their opinions and large quantities of messages containing negative word-of-mouth suddenly spread online, an online firestorm occurs. By extending the situational theory of problem solving (Kim and Grunig, 2011) into the domain of online communication, this study aims to identify the drivers for participating in online firestorms. Design/methodology/approach With reference to a fictitious online firestorm trigger (i.e. perceived moral misconduct) posted on Facebook, a qualitative pre-study and quantitative online survey were conducted. Based on the responses of 410 participants, an ordinary least squares regression was modeled to examine the factors of participating in the online firestorm. Later, structural equation modeling was applied to test the model and gauge its fit with the data. Findings Participants' involvement recognition, perception of being collective actors and approval of slacktivism behaviors positively predicted their participation in the online firestorm, whereas non-anonymity hampered it. Originality/value The study's findings not only contribute to the current understandings of online firestorms but are also valuable for developing theory and forms of professional crisis management. Moreover, they offer insights into the factors of online communication environments that encourage users to voice their opinions.","[Gruber, Maria; Mayer, Christiane; Einwiller, Sabine A.] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Einwiller, SA (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria.",sabine.einwiller@univie.ac.at,,"Einwiller, Sabine/0000-0002-3898-846X",,,,,62,13,14,2,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1468-4527,1468-4535,,ONLINE INFORM REV,Online Inf.

Institutions of higher learning or universities play a significant role in helping and shaping the students' personalities so that they can master the required set of skills needed in the workplace. It is evident that graduates' soft skills profieciency is directly related to the employability issues which are often raised. Drawing from the communication perspectives, this study sought to explore how local graduates respond towards the ability in mastering soft skills issue based on STOPS theory. A total of 415 respondents sampled from 2018 UKM graduates provided feedback on the survey. Data were analysed using the Structural Equation of Modeling (SEM) with the help of IBM-SPSS version 21 and IBM-SPSS-AMOS software. Five proposed hypotheses have been suported by the findings of the study. Results found that STOPS measurement model achieved the goodness-of-fit indexes. The R-2 value for the perceptual variables namely problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement recognition towards situational motivation in problem solving is .52 which indicated a moderately strong relationship. Furthermore, the R-2 value for referent criterion and situational motivation towards communicative action in problem solving (CAPS) yielded .61 which also exhibited a moderately strong relationship between variables. Based on that, related parties should provide more comprehensive exposure regarding the soft skills' mastery issue to improve student's ability to recognise the problem, constraints and involvments to contribute to the increment of motivation in problem solving.","[Ling, Ong Al; Kee, Chang Peng; Azlan, Arina Anis] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Pusat Kajian Media & Komunikasi MENTION, Fak Sains Sosial & Kemanusiaan, Bangi, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Ling, OA (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Pusat Kajian Media & Komunikasi MENTION, Fak Sains Sosial & Kemanusiaan, Bangi, Malaysia.",josie.oal@gmail.com; chang@ukm.edu.my; arina@ukm.edu.my,"Azlan, Arina Anis/AAS-2872-2020","Ong, Ai Ling/0009-0002-0243-3515",,,,,34,0,0,0,5,"NATL UNIV MALAYSIA, FAC SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES",SELANGOR,"UKM BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",2289-151X,2289-1528,,J KOMUN,J.

We found significant public engagement and government empowerment effects and partially significant public serenity effect.

Hence, this study was initiated to measure the level of new media literacy among the respondents and to examine the relationship between new media literacy and motivation in solving fake news problem. Data were collected through a survey among university students in Malaysia. The findings showed that only critical prosumption significantly contributed to motivation in solving fake news problem, and this dimension was also found to be the lowest level among the respondents.

Yet, being an informal caregiver involves significant health threats caused by so-called caregiver burden. To cope with the broad spectrum of challenges, informal caregivers seek social support in the care relationship network emerging around a (future) patient. However, obtaining social support is not limited to offline contexts. Members of online communities also provide experiential knowledge and social support. To explore how informal caregivers seek and provide social support online and how this is interrelated with their care relationship networks, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of 75 threads about advance care planning from German online forums (2003-2017). Our findings show that informal caregivers rely on what we conclusively coined communicative care (i.e., informational and emotional support in burdensome care situations), often in response to impaired offline relationships within care relationship networks.","[Menke, Manuel] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany; [Wagner, Anna J.

Findings The situational theory of problem solving (STOPS) was applied, and support was found for the STOPS model in terms of predicting communicative action. This study also found support for situational activeness influencing other behaviors, including active forms of communication, financial support, volunteer support and other forms of advocacy. Implications for practitioners managing communications or organizations involved in such efforts are discussed. Originality/value This research applied STOPS to study behaviors, including communication, volunteering, donating and participating in advocacy efforts as forms of prosocial behavior supporting different organizations related to many important issues.

Combining a cross-situational factor (i.e., pre-crisis relationship quality) and a situational factor (i.e., crisis-specific perceptions), this study segments internal publics to understand employees' motivations of becoming advocates for or adversaries of their organization. The results of an online survey demonstrated that employees' pre-crisis relationship to their organization plays a critical role in encouraging them to advocate for their company; meanwhile, their crisis-perception-whether they feel fewer constraints in solving a crisis-is more likely to make them share negative information externally. Segmented groups of employees with high levels of both relationship and activeness are most likely to engage in both positive and negative external communication behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications for public relations and internal crisis communication are suggested.","[Lee, Yeunjae] Univ Miami, Sch Commun, Dept Strateg Commun, 5100 Brunson Dr, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University of Miami,"Lee, Y (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Sch Commun, Dept Strateg Commun, 5100 Brunson Dr, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",yxl992@miami.edu,,,,,,,38,31,32,0,44,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

This study advances understanding of publics' crisis communicative and noncommunicative behaviors in the context of tornadoes through combining and extending two theories: the social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC) model and the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS). Findings from a survey of Southeast U.S. residents (n = 1,585) indicate that STOPS is internally consistent and accurate at measuring its intended outcomes of communicative action in problem solving. However, the STOPS measures do not have a significant relationship with the desirable outcome for imminent threat crisis communication: individuals following government's protective action guidance about tornadoes. In comparison, the expanded SMCC model predicts individuals' self-reported compliance. Finally, variables from the SMCC model and tornado-specific variables were integrated into the STOPS model to explain individuals' communicative engagement.

Compared to most previous studies that employ organization-centric networks where ties stand for hyperlinks, collaborations, or coalitions, the new approach projects organization-public relationships and public-public relationships onto interorganizational ties. By doing so, it (1) brings publics back into networked public relations research; (2) presents organizations and publics-the two most important subjects of public relations research-equally in the same network, (3) drives literature further away from a dyadic view of relationship management, and (4) constitutes one of the first techniques that can analyze direct and timely consequences of organziation-public relationships in the network ecology. To demonstrate the new approach, the network of publics overlap is introduced and applied to US-based LGBTQ advocacy groups. The essay also discusses the theoretical inquiries needed to further dual-projection networks, and invites scholars to create novel ways to incorporate publics into their network studies using dual projection.","[Zhou, Alvin] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Zhou, A (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",alvinyxz@upenn.edu,"Zhou, Alvin/L-3760-2019","Zhou, Alvin/0000-0001-5410-9712",,,,,98,23,24,3,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

Perceived message importance was associated with intentions to verify and share the message. Second, health anxiety interacted with perceived message importance only when predicting an intention to share the message. Last, healthy literacy interacted with perceived message importance when predicting intentions to both verify and share the message.

The problem is that there is currently no other particular way to distinguish fake opinions in a comments section than by resorting to poor human judgments. For years, most scholarly and industrial efforts have been directed at detecting fake consumer reviews of products or services. A technique for identifying deceptive opinions on social issues is largely underexplored and undeveloped. Inspired by the need for a reliable deceptive comment detection method, this study aims to develop an automated machine-learning technique capable of determining opinion trustworthiness in a comment section. In the process, we have created the first large-scale ground truth dataset consisting of 866 truthful and 869 deceptive comments on social issues. This is also one of the first attempts to detect comment deception in Asian languages (in Korean, specifically). The proposed machine-learning technique achieves nearly 81% accuracy in detecting untruthful opinions about social issues. This performance is quite consistent across issues and well beyond that of human judges.","[Oh, Yu Won] Sejong Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Chong Hyun] Sejong Univ, Coll Business Adm, 209 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05006, South Korea",Sejong University; Sejong University,"Park, CH (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Coll Business Adm, 209 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05006, South Korea.",chpark@sejong.ac.kr,"Oh, Yu Won/W-3924-2017","Oh, Yu Won/0000-0001-6258-103X; Park, Chong Hyun/0000-0003-4666-6994",,,,,31,12,13,0,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7642,1552-3381,,AM BEHAV SCI,Am.

The study finds that highly involved publics tend to attribute crisis responsibility more to the in-crisis company, and such attribution leads to stronger demand for regulatory intervention. However, the effects of issue involvement on public demands decrease when publics think they have collective efficacy to control crisis outcomes and that government has controllability over crisis outcomes. The study further finds that, in determining the degree of public demand, how publics attribute crisis responsibility is not as important as how they perceive government controllability. By delineating the relationships among issue involvement, responsibility attribution, perceived government controllability, and collective efficacy, this study outlines a comprehensive psychological mechanism of public demand for regulatory intervention during corporate crisis.","[Ji, Yingru] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Media & Int Culture, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Kim, Sora] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Ji, YR (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yingru.ji@gmail.com,"Ji, Yingru/K-3148-2019; Kim, Sora/HZK-4185-2023; Kim, Sora/G-9008-2018","Ji, Yingru/0000-0003-2969-2947; Kim, Sora/0000-0003-0557-6538",,,,,74,15,16,1,53,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,JUN,2020,22,6,,,,,959,983,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444819874473,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1461444819874473,,SEP 2019,25,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,LP8HB,,,,,2024-08-19,WOS:000490631400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite evidence from other disciplines that strategic messaging can influence behavior and attitudes, it remains unclear how to best design messages to benefit biodiversity. We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the status of conservation messaging research, and to evaluate whether studies address essential elements of message design and theory from other disciplines. We show that academic interest in conservation messaging is growing rapidly. However, our results suggest that conservation scientists are not effectively drawing from the long-standing expertise of disciplines with well-established messaging techniques. Many studies do not draw on established behavior change theories or audience segmentation techniques. Given the urgent need to address the loss of biodiversity, we discuss how conservation messaging can draw on existing empirical and theoretical knowledge, with a focus on the application of established techniques used in messaging for pro-environmental behavior.","[Kidd, Lindall R.; Garrard, Georgia E.; Bekessy, Sarah A.; Gordon, Ascelin; Gregg, Emily A.; Kusmanoff, Alexander M.; Selinske, Matthew J.] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Interdisciplinary Conservat Sci Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Kidd, Lindall R.; Garrard, Georgia E.; Bekessy, Sarah A.; Gregg, Emily A.; Kusmanoff, Alexander M.] Australian Govt Natl Environm Sci Program, Threatened Species Recovery Hub, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Bekessy, Sarah A.; Kusmanoff, Alexander M.; Selinske, Matthew J.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Mills, Morena] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Camilleri, Adrian R.] Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Fidler, Fiona] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia; [Fielding, Kelly S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Commun & Arts, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Louis, Winnifred] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Moon, Katie] Univ New South Wales, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Robinson, Jenny A.] RMIT Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Shanahan, Danielle] ZEALANDIA Ecosanctuary, Ctr People & Nat, Wellington, New Zealand; [Adams, Vanessa M.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Technol Environm & Design, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Queensland; Imperial College London; University of Technology Sydney; University of Melbourne; University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of New South Wales Sydney; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Tasmania,"Kidd, LR (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Interdisciplinary Conservat Sci Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",Lindall.kidd@gmail.com,"Louis, Winnifred/A-1968-2008; Shanahan, Danielle F/F-8437-2013; Gregg, Emily/X-8043-2019; Mills, Morena/AAD-8916-2019; Camilleri, Adrian R./V-9050-2019; Robinson, Jenny/ABE-4609-2021; Adams, Vanessa M./A-3834-2012; Fielding, Kelly S/A-6023-2011; Gordon, Ascelin/I-9184-2012","Louis, Winnifred/0000-0003-2996-982X; Gregg, Emily/0000-0002-0144-7854; Camilleri, Adrian R./0000-0002-9795-9597; Robinson, Jenny/0000-0001-6029-3309; Adams, Vanessa M./0000-0002-3509-7901; Kidd, Lindall/0000-0002-4443-2572; Selinske, Matthew/0000-0002-0191-9364; Moon, Katie/0000-0003-2538-9262; Kusmanoff, Alex/0000-0002-1344-1767; Fidler, Fiona/0000-0002-2700-2562; Gordon, Ascelin/0000-0002-0648-0346",Threatened Species Recovery Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions; ARC Future Fellowship,Threatened Species Recovery Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council); ARC Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council),"This research was conducted with funding support from the Threatened Species Recovery Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program and the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions.

Results of a structural equation modelling analysis supported all the causal links in the conceptual model. Moreover, communicative action significantly mediated the relationship between referent criterion and environmental engagement. Problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement recognition did not influence environmental engagement directly, but exerted their significant indirect impact via two key mediators in the model: situational motivation in problem solving and communicative action in problem solving.

However, not all foreign publics are the same; they represent a collection of separate public opinions. As such, foreign publics need to be segmented and differentiated in order for countries to strategically invest their resources and optimize public diplomacy outcomes. In light of this, this paper proposes a taxonomy which approaches the concept of foreign publics as an intersection between symbolic environment and behavioral experiences. By classifying foreign publics into four segments (i.e., ambassadorial, advocational, accusational, and adversarial), this paper explains the formation and characteristics of each segment of foreign publics, as well as their implications for a country's public diplomacy efforts.","[Tam, Lisa] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kim, Jeong-Nam] Univ Oklahoma, Gaylord Coll Journalism & Mass Commun, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Tam, L (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",l.tam@qut.edu.au,"Tam, Lisa/I-6237-2019; Kim, Jeong-Nam/KIC-4758-2024","Tam, Lisa/0000-0001-6520-6120; Kim, Jeong-Nam/0000-0002-4254-5784",,,,,71,17,18,0,6,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1751-8040,1751-8059,,PLACE BRANDING PUBLI,Place Branding Public Dipl.,MAR,2019,15,1,,,,,28,37,,10.1057/s41254-018-0104-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41254-018-0104-z,,,10,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,HT8UH,,,,,2024-08-19,WOS:000464839700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

While a fundamental part of any issue arena is the distinction between active and passive actors, empirical analyses have mainly focused on active stakeholders. We approach issue arenas as communication networks in which active stakeholders discuss topics and involve passive stakeholders. Based on network theory, we introduce an automated method for mapping these issue arenas on Twitter. In particular, we combine manual coding of active stakeholders, and automated semantic network analysis of addressed, passive stakeholders and their topics of discussion. Empirically, we focus on the issue of bird flu affecting poultry farming in the Netherlands from 2015 to 2017 with a sample of 704 Twitter messages. Instead of pre-defining a set of stakeholders for the analysis, our approach to study communication networks in online settings allows for mapping issue arenas based on the stakeholders that communicate about the topic.","[Hellsten, Iina; Jacobs, Sandra; Wonneberger, Anke] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Postbus 15793, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Hellsten, I (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Postbus 15793, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",i.r.hellsten@uva.nl,,,,,,,59,29,30,1,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

HIV stigma may be particularly common in rural areas of China, where village doctors (i.e., barefoot doctors) have limited medical training yet are charged with providing frontline care for much of China's rural population. Therefore, the present study aims to use communication and behavioral theory to better understand Chinese village doctors' beliefs about HIV, including their willingness to become involved in HIV treatment and care. In collaboration with the Behai Centers for Disease Control, we surveyed 228 village doctors in rural China to learn about their experiences in providing HIV treatment and care. We then applied a hybrid theoretical model, combining variables from the Situational Theory of Publics and the Theory of Reasoned Action, to explain providers' communication, attitudes, and behaviors. Findings suggest that enhanced information activity about HIV may increase providers' self-efficacy in caring for HIV patients and yield more positive attitudes towards caring for people living with HIV.

We examined mediation effects of message elaboration on issue involvement and affect as well as moderation effects of dispositional skepticism on the relationships between affect, and attitude and behavioral intention. Results from two message-embedded surveys show that for the two types of messages used, issue involvement was positively correlated with positive affect and, consequently, with attitude and behavioral intention. However, for episodically framed messages, route-of-information processing mediated the relationship between issue involvement and affect. Dispositional skepticism moderated the relationship between positive affect and attitude toward the organization for these messages but did not affect behavioral intention. Overall, the findings suggest that prioritizing fact-based messaging over story-based messaging for involved publics could improve communication of the impact of CSR programs.","[Dhanesh, Ganga S.] Zayed Univ, Coll Commun & Media Sci, POB 19282, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Nekmat, Elmie] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore",Zayed University; National University of Singapore,"Dhanesh, GS (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Coll Commun & Media Sci, POB 19282, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",ganga.dhanesh@zu.ac.ae,"Nekmat, Elmie/AAF-8185-2019; Dhanesh, Ganga S/W-3291-2019","Nekmat, Elmie/0000-0003-4520-8887; Dhanesh, Ganga S/0000-0002-2471-9808","Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, National University of Singapore","Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a Start-up Grant offered by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, National University of Singapore.",,91,27,29,10,50,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0893-3189,1552-6798,,MANAGE COMMUN Q,Manag.

A diverse population with variations in culture, language and religion is often perceived as difficult to govern due to the many different needs, values and expectations of different groups within a multicultural society. Malaysia is often lauded for the inter-ethnic harmony and stability of its society that allows the country to flourish economically. Though there is no violent conflict between the ethnic groups, a sense of national unity proves challenging to achieve as ethnic divides exist along political, socio-economical and geographical lines. This study was conducted to investigate how Malaysian youth participate in the conversation about inter-ethnic unity. Utilising measures of Communicative Actions in Problem Solving from the Situational Theory of Problem Solving (STOPS), a survey was distributed among 575 university students from four institutions of higher learning in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to determine whether there were any differences between the three main ethnic groups on the six different communicative behaviours pertaining to the issue of inter-ethnic unity. The results showed that there were significant differences in information seeking, information forwarding and information sharing. Among these behaviours, the differences between the Malays and the Chinese were most prominent whereby the Chinese showed relatively lower levels of information seeking and sharing compared to the Malays, and lower levels of information forwarding compared to both the Malays and the Indians.","[Azlan, Arina Anis] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Ctr Commun & Digital Soc, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Bangi, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Azlan, AA (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Ctr Commun & Digital Soc, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Bangi, Malaysia.",arina@ukm.edu.my,"Azlan, Arina Anis/AAS-2872-2020; AZIZ, AHMAD AZLAN/AAK-6182-2020","AZIZ, AHMAD AZLAN/0000-0002-6773-5365; Azlan, Arina Anis/0000-0001-5484-1188","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme - Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education Malaysia [FRGS/1/2011/SS/UKM/03/6]","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme - Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education Malaysia","This study was conducted as part of a larger research project funded by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2011/SS/UKM/03/6) awarded by the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education Malaysia.",,66,1,1,0,14,"NATL UNIV MALAYSIA, FAC SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES",SELANGOR,"UKM BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",2289-151X,2289-1528,,J KOMUN,J.

Radio not only helps farmers in acquiring information, but also creates a tendency for farmers to deal with informational interaction and to stay connected with the problem. For that reason, under structural governance reforms such as decentralisation, radio is expected to have an influence on farmers' actual perception and opinion in minimising the problem when used in the AES informational delivery process. Drawing upon the Situational Theory Problem Solving (STOPS), this study seeks to determine the role of radio in problem solving (RIPS) on the perceptual situation variables which include problem recognition, constraint recognition, involvement recognition, and referent criterion towards solving insufficient information delivery. A total of 400 farmers within AES or the Rice Bowl area of Northern Malaysia participated in answering the questionnaire. Data was analysed using the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The findings reveal that RIPS plays an important role in influencing farmers' problem recognition, involvement recognition, and referent criterion apart from reducing their constraint. As a result, all of the four hypothesised relationships proposed in the study's conceptual model were significant and supported. Hence, RIPS can now be considered as a joint element in public communication strategy to deal and solve insufficient information delivery for Malaysia's AES.","[Ismail, Idris] Univ Sains Islam Malaysia, Fac Leadership & Management, Commun Publ Commun, Nilai, Malaysia; [Sabran, Rosidayu] Univ Sains Islam Malaysia, Commun Program, Nilai, Malaysia; [Ariffin, Mohd Yahya Mohamed] Univ Sains Islam Malaysia, Fac Leadership & Management, Nilai, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia; Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia; Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia,"Ismail, I (corresponding author), Univ Sains Islam Malaysia, Fac Leadership & Management, Commun Publ Commun, Nilai, Malaysia.",idriscruise@yahoo.com; rosidayu@usim.edu.my; mohdyms@usim.edu.my,,"Sabran, Rosidayu/0000-0003-4383-0859",,,,,44,1,1,0,4,"NATL UNIV MALAYSIA, FAC SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES",SELANGOR,"UKM BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",2289-151X,2289-1528,,J KOMUN,J.

While extant research suggests that CSR initiatives that are highly congruent with a company's products or services tend to generate more favorable public outcomes, this study tested hypotheses suggesting fit would likely function differently within stigmatized industries. In these instances, although the company and CSR issue are logically connected, the association is a negative one, as the company or its products have a negative impact on society that it is attempting to address (or appear to address) through a CSR initiative. An experiment involving a fictitious cola company and its promotion of anti-obesity versus literacy CSR activities was used to examine the effect of fit with negative contribution on skepticism, attitudes toward the company and the CSR initiative, and participants' stated supportive intentions toward the company. In partial support of the hypotheses, findings revealed that, for the high-fit negative contribution CSR initiative (anti-obesity), skepticism was heightened while both attitudes toward the company and supportive intentions toward the company's products were negatively impacted, in comparison with the low-fit CSR initiative (literacy). While attitudes about the social initiatives of anti-obesity versus literacy were not significantly different, findings also suggest participants felt obesity was a more important cause for the cola company to undertake. The practical and ethical implications for CSR are discussed.","[Austin, Lucinda] Univ N Carolina, Sch Media & Journalism, Carroll Hall,CB 3365, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Gaither, Barbara Miller] Elon Univ, Sch Commun, Elon, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Elon University,"Austin, L (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Media & Journalism, Carroll Hall,CB 3365, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",lucinda.austin@unc.edu; bmiller9@elon.edu,,"Austin, Lucinda/0000-0002-3047-3701",,,,,54,27,30,4,33,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1350-231X,1479-1803,,J BRAND MANAG,J.

Hence, it is important for managers to identify factors that impact consumers' intentions to write online reviews. This research delves into this aspect by trying to identify the factors that impact reviews writing intentions of consumers for restaurants. The study extends the theory of planned behaviour with additions of variables such as ego involvement, taking vengeance and helping a restaurant. For this, 252 valid responses were obtained, and structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model. Results indicate that perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, ego involvement and taking vengeance are significant predictors of intention to write online reviews for the restaurants.","[Dixit, Saumya] NorthCap Univ, Gurugram, India; [Badgaiyan, Anant Jyoti] VIMR, Satna, MP, India; [Khare, Arpita] IIM Rohtak, Mkt Area, Rohtak, Haryana, India",The Northcap University; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Rohtak,"Badgaiyan, AJ (corresponding author), VIMR, Satna, MP, India.",saumya.pie@gmail.com; anantjyoti@gmail.com; khare.arpita@gmail.com,,,,,,,73,52,52,5,95,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-6989,1873-1384,,J RETAIL CONSUM SERV,J.

The findings revealed landscape irrigators recognize water use as an issue but exhibit a low level of communicative action when addressing the issue. In addition, as their perceived level of involvement increases, they are less likely to communicate about water conservation, revealing a sense of cognitive dissonance and discomfort with their behavior to the point they would rather not discuss the problem. Recommendations include encouraging environmental communication professionals to communicate at the community level to discuss community conservation effects, utilize existing clientele to develop a sense of involvement among their circles of influence and encourage the use of social media techniques when communicating to further their reach.","[Lamm, Alexa J.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr Leadership Educ & Commun, 318 Hoke Smith Bldg, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Warner, Laura A.; Lundy, Lisa K.; Bommidi, Jyothi Swaroop] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Beattie, Peyton N.] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Lamm, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Agr Leadership Educ & Commun, 318 Hoke Smith Bldg, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",alamm@uga.edu; lsanagorski@ufl.edu; lisalundy@ufl.edu; swaroopphd@ufl.edu; pbeattie@uga.edu,,"Warner, Laura/0000-0003-2784-6666; Lamm, Alexa/0000-0003-1999-8803",University of Florida Center for Landscape Conservation and Ecology,University of Florida Center for Landscape Conservation and Ecology,Funding for this research was provided by the University of Florida Center for Landscape Conservation and Ecology.,,35,6,7,4,45,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,1872-6062,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

Using the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS) as an analytical framework, a case study is conducted to examine the association between the extent of news coverage and online discussions surrounding a territorial dispute between the Chinese and Japanese Governments. Several findings are made, including that: (a) there is a positive relationship between the amount of news coverage and online discussions surrounding the dispute, (b) nationalist publics interpreted the international dispute as affecting them personally (i.e., displaying international issue personalization effects), and (c) nationalist publics proposed using collective approaches to cope with the dispute. Implications of the findings for public diplomacy are discussed.","[Tam, Lisa] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Lee, Yeunjae] Purdue Univ, Brian Lamb Sch Commun, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Tam, L (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",l.tam@qut.edu.au,"Tam, Lisa/I-6237-2019","Tam, Lisa/0000-0001-6520-6120",,,,,47,6,7,0,19,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1751-8040,1751-8059,,PLACE BRANDING PUBLI,Place Branding Public Dipl.,NOV,2018,14,4,,,,,225,233,,10.1057/s41254-017-0075-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41254-017-0075-5,,,9,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,HH7RR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-08-19,WOS:000455928700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study uses a mixed-method approach to analyze dialogue in a crisis-semantic network analysis and content analysis. Specifically, this study examines the emotional expression and crisis coping behaviors on social media during two separate terror attacks: the Paris terror attacks in 2015 and the Barcelona terror attacks in 2017. Results demonstrate how publics may be identified and understood through semantic network analysis and content analysis. This study also shows the connection between emotions and coping, expanding the crisis communication literature in public relations, and suggests the need to consider agenda-setting and resilience in crisis communication research.

More and more people hesitate or even reject vaccinations. As the influence of the internet grows, the question becomes how to communicate about vaccination to parents in order to prevent this drop in vaccination coverage among children. Methods: For the first time in Europe, the Situational Theory of Publics (STOP) has been used in the field of vaccination to segment mothers to subpublics, and to prescribe a clearly defined form of communication for each of the segmented groups. In the survey, 1704 mothers participated who gave birth in 2014 and 2015 in Slovenia. Results: The study showed that mothers react passively to information on vaccination no matter whether they come across it coincidentally or intentionally. Most often, they seek information about vaccination from friends or online. The more concerned they are about the safety of vaccines, the more they search for information about vaccination, and their communication is consequently more active. The mothers that problematize the safety of vaccines more, and are afraid of their adverse events tend to be in favour of alternative options. Conclusions: Our research demonstrated that the STOP can be applied to the field of vaccination. There is a huge need for intensive professional communication about vaccination on the internet and social media. The improvement of the communicational competences of doctors and healthcare workers is essential to achieve better communication with parents and the media, and needs to be focused on mothers and pregnant women.","[Vrdelja, Mitja] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Commun Dept, Trubarjeva 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Kraigher, Alenka] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Communicable Dis, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Vercic, Dejan] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Dept Commun, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kropivnik, Samo] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Chair Mkt Commun & Publ Relat, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana,"Vrdelja, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Commun Dept, Trubarjeva 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",mitja.vrdelja@nijz.si,,,Slovenian Agency Research Agency; Ministry of Health Slovenia [L7-6806],Slovenian Agency Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); Ministry of Health Slovenia,"Source(s) of support in the form of a grant, the authors acknowledge funding from The Slovenian Agency Research Agency and Ministry of Health Slovenia (project number L7-6806).",,39,38,47,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1101-1262,1464-360X,,EUR J PUBLIC HEALTH,Eur.

This study further proposes a conceptual model describing how the overall tone and the perceived frequency of sojourners' communication affect the information recipients' perceptions and behavioral intentions. The mediating role of perceived information quality on the information recipients is also considered. Data were collected from foreign sojourners in Macao and information recipients in China. The results show a significant association between sojourners' self-confidence and their communicative action, and they provide additional insight on the impact of foreign sojourners' communication on information recipients' perceptual and behavioral reactions and the mediating role of perceived information quality.","[Choi, Suh Hee] Tourism Coll, Inst Tourism Studies, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hung Che] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Sch Business, 882 Wenquan Ave, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Macao University of Tourism; Nanfang College, Guangzhou; Sun Yat Sen University","Wu, HC (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Sch Business, 882 Wenquan Ave, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",suhhee@ift.edu.mo; wuhungche66@gmail.com,"Wu, Hung-Che/H-4859-2019; Choi, Suh-hee/AAD-1655-2020","Choi, Suh-hee/0000-0002-4711-7383; Wu, Hung-Che/0000-0001-5282-8473",,,,,36,16,16,2,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-571X,,,J DESTIN MARK MANAGE,J.

Structural Equation Modeling tested the proposed model with survey data collected from 408 U.S. adult residents via Amazon's MTurk. Results indicated that salience, knowledge, and relevance were strong indicators of cognitive proximity, whereas emotional connectedness and empathy were determinants of emotional proximity.

To what extent do these differences exist? The purpose of this research was to investigate the perceptions of inter-ethnic unity in Malaysia among the three main ethnic groups. A survey measuring perceptions on the issue of inter-ethnic unity was distributed among 575 university students at four different institutions of higher learning in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The results show that the different ethnic groups held similar problem perceptions in terms of problem recognition, involvement, constraint recognition, and did not differ significantly in terms of their social position on the problem. There were however, significant differences between the Chinese and Malay/Bumiputeras, as well as between the Chinese and Indians when it came to perceived level of knowledge and experience about the problem. The findings indicate that different ethnic groups may be differently equipped to handle the issue of inter-ethnic unity in Malaysia.

Using a recently developed holistic model of behavioral branding, that suggests that a wide array of managerial strategies affects the branding process, this study addresses two specific questions: what communication strategies, in the opinion of managers, sustain employee brand consistent behavior? And what are the most important factors, both contextual and related to their cognitive-emotional states, that employees think affect their brand ambassadorship behavior? Design/methodology/approach - A long-term research program was conducted based on a multiple methods research strategy to answer the two questions. The choice of different methods was mainly based on the specific characteristics of the two targets: communication managers and employees. The first one based on interviews with 32 managers, and the second one based on a case study of a single company. Findings - The results show that enablement-oriented strategies are more effective than communication-oriented strategies in sustaining employee brand builder roles. Weak employee commitment, unsatisfactory external communication, and low levels of motivation are strong contextual factors inhibiting employee attitudes to brand ambassadorship, one of the most relevant employee brand consistent behaviors in competitive contexts. The main practical implication is that companies should engage employees as brand ambassadors, not by means of prescriptions of in-role behavior, but enablement strategies leading to authentic and voluntary behaviors; besides, that companies should put a significant effort in preparing the soil, i.e. investing in enhancing employee commitment, level of motivation, and understanding/alignment with the external communication. Practical implications - The main practical implication is that companies should engage employees as brand ambassadors not by means of in-role behavior prescriptions rather by means of enablement strategies leading to authentic and voluntary behaviors. Besides, managers should invest significant efforts in enhancing employee motivation, commitment, and understanding/alignment to external communication as they represent key factors in sustaining brand ambassadorship behaviors. Originality/value - The values of the study lies in having highlighted the crucial role of enablement-oriented strategies, and the relevance of specific contextual variables affecting the attitude of employee toward brand consistent behaviors.","[Quaratino, Luca] IULM Univ, Org Theory & Human Resource Management, Milan, Italy; [Mazzei, Alessandra] IULM Univ, Corp Commun & Publ Relat, Milan, Italy",IULM International University Languages & Media; IULM International University Languages & Media,"Quaratino, L (corresponding author), IULM Univ, Org Theory & Human Resource Management, Milan, Italy.",luca.quaratino@iulm.it; alessandra.mazzei@iulm.it,"Mazzei, Alessandra/I-4024-2014",,,,,,73,17,19,0,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1450-2194,1758-888X,,EUROMED J BUS,EuroMed J.

This study examines this line of expectation concerning the role social media may play in health campaigns by testing an integrated health campaign model that combines insights from research on social media-specific perceptions and communicative behaviors in order to predict health behaviors. Specifically, this study aims to (a) develop a more holistic social media campaign model for predicting health behaviors in the social media context, (b) investigate how social media channel-related perceptions affect preventive health behaviors, and (c) investigate how communicative behaviors mediate perceptions and behavioral intention. The study conducted an online survey of 498 females who followed the Purple Ribbon Twitter campaign (@pprb), a cervical cancer prevention campaign. The results indicated that information acquisition mediated perceived risk's effect on intention. Information acquisition also mediated the relationships between intention and information selection and information transmission. On the other hand, social media-related perceptions indirectly impacted behavioral intention through communicative behaviors.

By doing so, this study provides meaningful insight into: new crisis communication theory development that takes a strategic management approach, emphasizing employees' valuable assets from an organization, and effective crisis communication practice that reduces misalignment with employees and that enhances voluntary and positive ECBs for the organization during a crisis. Design/methodology/approach This study conducted a nationwide survey in the USA among full-time employees (n=544). After dimensionality check through confirmatory factor analysis, this study tested hypothesis and research question by conducting ordinary least squares multiple regression analyses using STATA 13. Findings This study found that strategic internal communication factors, including two-way symmetrical communication and transparent communication, were positive and strong antecedents of ECBs for sensemaking and sensegiving in crisis situations, when controlling for other effects. The post hoc analysis confirmed theses positive and strong associations across different industry areas. Originality/value This study suggests that voluntary and valuable ECBs can be enhanced by listening and responding to employee concerns and interests; encouraging employee participation in crisis communication; and organizational accountability through words, actions and decisions during the crisis. As a theoretical implication, the results of this study indicate the need for crisis communication theories that emphasize employees as valuable assets to an organization.","[Kim, Young] Marquette Univ, J William & Mary Diederich Coll Commun, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Marquette University,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Marquette Univ, J William & Mary Diederich Coll Commun, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",enteryoung@gmail.com,"Kim, Young/Q-5459-2019",,,,,,106,79,90,0,73,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1363-254X,1478-0852,,J COMMUN MANAG,J.

This study examined the role of perceived fit between an MLB team and its two CSR initiatives in shaping consumers' intentions to support the team's CSR efforts. Design/methodology/approach - A between-subjects experiment (n=207) was conducted using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to examine the impact of CSR fit on consumers' patronage intentions. Findings - The results of this study showed that consumers' perceived fit between sports teams and their CSR has a positive impact on consumers' patronage intentions. The values-driven and strategic-driven attributions of the team's CSR initiatives were positively associated with their patronage intentions. Research limitations/implications - Both the values-driven and strategic-driven attributions were positively associated with consumers' patronage intentions, while previous studies suggested negative association between strategic-driven attributions and consumer behaviors. The findings indicate that consumers do not view professional sports teams' strategic-driven CSR initiatives to be negative business practices. This could result from the fact that CSR initiatives have become a prevalent and expected organizational practice. Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature of CSR within the context of professional sports teams as corporations. The findings of this study suggest that professional sports teams could benefit from CSR initiatives when the teams select social causes with which consumers could infer values-driven and strategic-driven attributions.","[Kim, Joon Kyoung; Overton, Holly; Hull, Kevin; Choi, Minhee] Univ South Carolina, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Overton, H (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",overton@sc.edu,"Kim, Joon Kyoung/AAD-4898-2019; Hull, Kevin/KIH-3982-2024","Kim, Joon Kyoung/0000-0001-9325-5667; Hull, Kevin/0000-0001-6461-4069",,,,,82,13,20,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3289,1758-6046,,CORP COMMUN,Corp.

Based on the heuristic-systematic model (HSM), this study explores the way by which individuals process health information from television medical talk shows. Specifically, this study examines the relationship between information exposure, information appraisals (e.g., appropriateness and incoherence), information behaviors (e.g., information seeking and sharing), and unconditional acceptance of health information. Results from a survey of 588 women in South Korean indicate that an individual's appraisal of information as being appropriate or incoherent influences unconditional acceptance of health information. Both types of information appraisals are positively associated with information seeking, which is negatively associated with unconditional acceptance of information. In contrast, neither of these appraisals have an impact on unconditional acceptance via information sharing. Notably, when information appraisals are not considered, information exposure is positively associated with information sharing, which is then positively associated with unconditional acceptance. Implications for health information consumers and practitioners are discussed.","[Jeong, Jae-Seon] Hallym Univ, Ctr Hlth Commun Studies, 16403 Toegye Hall,39 Hallymdaehak Gil, Chunchon, South Korea; [Lee, Seungyoon] Purdue Univ, Brian Lamb Sch Commun, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Hallym University; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Jeong, JS (corresponding author), Hallym Univ, Ctr Hlth Commun Studies, 16403 Toegye Hall,39 Hallymdaehak Gil, Chunchon, South Korea.",jaeseonjeong@hallym.ac.kr,,,,,,,50,6,7,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1041-0236,1532-7027,,HEALTH COMMUN,Health Commun.,,2018,33,8,,,,,972,979,,10.1080/10410236.2017.1323365,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2017.1323365,,,8,Communication; Health Policy & Services,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Health Care Sciences & Services,GG2SG,28557534,,,,2024-08-19,WOS:000432542300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

A survey collected data from 1,463 participants at two healthcare centers in China. Based on the structural equation modeling, multiple dimensions of risk perception play a distinctive role in communicating online health information and forming health behavioral intention.

Results indicate that individuals who are exposed to contradictory health information, currently engage in risky health behavior, are comfortable using the Internet to search for information, and are currently taking steps to maintain their health are likely to actively select health information that confirms their preexisting notions about their health, and to reject information that is contradictory to their beliefs.

Studies have increasingly stressed the importance of customizing approaches directed at women's health issues according to stages in the female life cycle. In Korea, however, gender-specific studies on issues affecting Korean women in relation to stages in their life cycle are lacking. Accordingly, the Korean Study of Women's Health-Related Issues (K-Stori) was designed to investigate life cycle-specific health issues among women, covering health status, awareness, and risk perceptions. Methods: K-Stori was conducted as a nationwide cross-sectional survey targeting Korean women aged 14-79 years. Per each stage in the female life cycle (adolescence, childbearing age, pregnancy & postpartum, menopause, and older adult stage), 3000 women (total 15,000) were recruited by stratified multistage random sampling for geographic area based on the 2010 Resident Registration Population in Korea. Specialized questionnaires per each stage (total of five) were developed in consultation with multidisciplinary experts and by reflecting upon current interests into health among the general population of women in Korea. This survey was conducted from April 1 to June 31, 2016, at which time investigators from a professional research agency went door-to-door to recruit residents and conducted in-person interviews. Discussion: The study's findings may help with elucidating health issues and unmet needs specific to each stage in the life cycle of Korean women that have yet to be identified in present surveys.","[Cho, Ha Na; Choi, Eunji; Park, Boyoung; Choi, Kui Son] Natl Canc Ctr, Grad Sch Canc Sci & Policy, 323 Ilsan Ro, Goyang Si 10408, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Seo, Da Hea] Inha Univ, Sch Med, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Incheon, South Korea; [Suh, Mina] Natl Canc Ctr, Natl Canc Control Inst, Goyang, South Korea; [Lee, Hoo-Yeon] Dankook Univ, Coll Med, Dept Social Med, Cheonan, South Korea; [Park, Sohee] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Juhee] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Clin Res & Evaluat, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Sue] Yonsei Univ, Coll Nursing, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Yeong-Ran] Kangnam Univ, Div Silver Ind, Yongin, South Korea; [Ahn, Younjihin; Park, Hyun-Young] Korea Natl Inst Hlth, Ctr Biomed Sci, Div Cardiovasc Dis, Osong, South Korea; [Rhee, Yumie] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Severance Hosp, Dept Internal Med,Endocrine Res Inst, Seoul 03722, South Korea",National Cancer Center - Korea (NCC); Inha University; National Cancer Center - Korea (NCC); Dankook University; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Kangnam University; Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency (KDCA); Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH); Korea CDC Center for Biomedical Science; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System,"Choi, KS (corresponding author), Natl Canc Ctr, Grad Sch Canc Sci & Policy, 323 Ilsan Ro, Goyang Si 10408, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.;Rhee, Y (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Severance Hosp, Dept Internal Med,Endocrine Res Inst, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",kschoi@ncc.re.kr; YUMIE@yuhs.ac,"Park, Sohee/IQW-3799-2023; Cho, Juhee/ABD-2280-2021; Kim, Sue/HOF-5687-2023; Rhee, Yumie/L-8020-2019","Kim, Sue/0000-0003-3785-2445; Rhee, Yumie/0000-0003-4227-5638; Park, Sohee/0000-0001-8513-5163",Korea Center for Diseases Control and Prevention [2015ER630300],Korea Center for Diseases Control and Prevention,This study was funded by the Korea Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (Grant number: 2015ER630300).,,35,8,9,1,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2458,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,JUN 29,2017,17,,,,,,,,609,10.1186/s12889-017-4531-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-017-4531-1,,,9,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",FB0YL,28662652,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-19,WOS:000405870800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Public emergency events have occurred frequently, and social media have developed rapidly. Social media users in China not only represent traditional audiences but also play an increasingly important role in crisis communication during public emergency events by expressing their views, discussing events with others and sharing information both online and offline. According to national telephone survey data from China, nearly two-thirds of the respondents engaged in communication behaviors during public emergency events, and more than forty percent of those users communicated by social media. Hundreds of millions of Chinese social media users are becoming the driving force of the public opinion field. To better understand social media users' online information dissemination behaviors and influencing factors, we developed the hierarchical logistic regression model and observed that demographic variables (gender and age), social media use, people's concerns regarding public emergencies and people's need to monitor the government's performance during public emergencies significantly influence online information dissemination behaviors.

When there is extensive media coverage on news about the dispute, nationalist sentiments in both two countries would be triggered and could be expressed through detrimental behaviors towards transnational corporations (hereinafter TNCs). While TNCs play a significant political function as corporate diplomats for their home countries, they are subject to the risk of crises when their home countries are involved in political and economic conflicts with the foreign countries in which they have operations. Against this backdrop, this paper seeks to examine the roles of TNCs with reference to three cases of nationalism-induced crises in China. It proposes relational principles based on which TNCs could implement strategies to mitigate the damage from nationalism-induced crises and contribute to their home countries' diplomatic goals as corporate diplomats.","[Tam, Lisa] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kim, Soojin] Singapore Management Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Business, Singapore, Singapore",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Singapore Management University,"Tam, L (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Advertising Mkt & Publ Relat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",lisalstam@gmail.com; soojin.pr@googlemail.com,"Tam, Lisa/I-6237-2019","Tam, Lisa/0000-0001-6520-6120",,,,,67,6,6,0,16,JOHN BENJAMINS PUBLISHING CO,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 ME AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0957-6851,1569-9838,,J ASIAN PAC COMMUN,J.

Individuals who converge into collectives are viewed as influential forces in the creation of problem perception, and have the potential to influence society and pressure the organisations within it. For this reason, understanding audiences and managing information is of interest to communications practitioners and scholars alike. Of late, the study of the individual problem solving process has become an important focus; more specifically, the communicative behaviour of individuals and the factors that influence these communicative behaviours. Previous studies have examined three key antecedent factors that determine an individual's participation in communicative action: problem recognition, involvement recognition, and constraint recognition. This study proposes that the problem solving process is also influenced by contextual factors that may limit or encourage communicative behaviour. The purpose of this study was to delineate the situation in the individual problem solving process and construct a quantitative measure of perceived situation complexity. A synthesis of extant literature produced preliminary dimensions and items that were tested through a survey distributed among 152 university students. Exploratory factor analysis yielded six main dimensions: solution complexity, referent criterion, negative feelings toward the problem, environmental salience, problem familiarity, and uncertainty of a solution. These results provide initial guidance into exploring the concept of context in individual problem solving and the consequences on communicative action.","[Azlan, Arina Anis] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Media Impact & Creat Ind Res Ctr, Bangi, Malaysia; [Rahim, Samsudin A.] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Commun, Bangi, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Azlan, AA (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Media Impact & Creat Ind Res Ctr, Bangi, Malaysia.",arina@ukm.edu.my; samsudinukm@gmail.com,"Rahim, Samsudin A./K-1687-2019; Azlan, Arina Anis/AAS-2872-2020; AZIZ, AHMAD AZLAN/AAK-6182-2020","AZIZ, AHMAD AZLAN/0000-0002-6773-5365; Azlan, Arina Anis/0000-0001-5484-1188",,,,,29,4,4,0,2,"NATL UNIV MALAYSIA, FAC SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES",SELANGOR,"UKM BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",2289-151X,2289-1528,,J KOMUN,J.

The vast majority of studies on Agenda Setting have found widespread support for a media influence on issue salience despite studies used different methodologies and issues. The theory postulates that people were simply led to think about the agenda as set by the media. The salience of the media agenda would then be reflected as the people agenda, measured through rank correlation. With the emergence of technologies, questions arise among scholars about whether the theory on Agenda Setting would remain viable in later years and whether people would continue to obtain their news from a given number of media outlets, given the range of new media channels being made available over the years. The discussion of this study contributes to a better understanding of agenda setting in current Malaysian media landscape.","[Idid, Syed Arabi] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Commun, Kulliyyah Islamic Revealed Knowledge & Human Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia,"Idid, SA (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Commun, Kulliyyah Islamic Revealed Knowledge & Human Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Malaysia.",sarabidid@iium.edu.my,"Idid, Syed Arabi A/E-1033-2016",,,,,,36,3,3,0,5,"NATL UNIV MALAYSIA, FAC SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES",SELANGOR,"UKM BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",2289-151X,2289-1528,,J KOMUN,J.

It was learnt that those problem solving frameworks are originated mainly from practical exercises of practitioners and/or improvement/revision of an earlier frameworks. Against this bottom-up approach in the establishment of problem solving frameworks, this paper continues promoting the establishment of a problem solving framework following top-down approach by synthesizing the deductive inference i.e., the second inference process of Pragmatism's scientific method. The synthesis has resulted in the identification of the decision sub-processes of Pragmatism's deductive inference namely analysis and demonstration. This paper posits that these two decision processes are aligned with both the key and strategies of the decision processes of the renowned problem solving frameworks in practice in management, business, mathematics, healthcare and law and hence, the decision processes of deductive inference in particular and Pragmatism's philosophical method in general is an alternative for decision making processes and problem solving frameworks following the top-down approach.","[Rahman, Safawi Abdul; Abu Bakar, Amzari; Rahmad, Fadilnor; Amin, Zahari Mohd; Seman, Mohd Ridwan] Univ Teknol MARA Selangor, Fac Informat Management, Campus Puncak Perdana, Shah Alam 40150, Selangor, Malaysia; [Haron, Haryani; Nordin, Sharifalillah] Univ Teknol MARA Selangor, Fac Comp & Math Sceince, Shah Alam 40000, Selangor, Malaysia",,"Rahman, SA (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA Selangor, Fac Informat Management, Campus Puncak Perdana, Shah Alam 40150, Selangor, Malaysia.",,"Haron, Haryani/ABB-7306-2021; Nordin, Sharifalillah/ABB-6094-2021","ABU BAKAR, AMZARI/0000-0003-3268-0023; Abdul Rahman, Safawi/0000-0002-0924-5413","Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia","Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)","This paper describes the second part of the work done at doctoral level that investigates the essence of intelligence and intelligent behavior based on problem solving and decision making processes.

J,"Kang, M; Sung, M","Kang, Minjeong; Sung, Minjung",,,How symmetrical employee communication leads to employee engagement and positive employee communication behaviors The mediation of employee-organization relationships,JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,Internal communication; Corporate communication; Public relations; Employee engagement; Communication management; Employee communication,INTERNAL COMMUNICATION; STRATEGIES; SATISFACTION; INVESTMENT; LEADERSHIP; GENDER; IMPACT; MODEL,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how a company's symmetrical internal communication efforts could influence its employees' perception of relationship outcomes with the company and the subsequent employee communication behaviors about the company to others and their turnover intention. Additionally, the mediation effects of employee-organization relationship (EOR) quality between symmetrical internal communication and employee engagement were tested. Design/methodology/approach - The study collected the data from a survey of randomly selected 438 individuals who work as sales representatives of the case organization. Respondents were randomly selected through stratified sampling. For the overall statistical procedure, this study adopted the two-step structural equation modeling: on the basis of the final measurement model analysis from confirmatory factor analysis, the proposed structural model was tested using latent variables. Findings - The findings of this research clearly demonstrate: employee/internal communication management is linked with employee engagement; employee engagement enhances supportive employee communication behaviors and reduces turnover intention. Also, the mediation results show strong mediation of EORs on the effects of symmetrical internal communication on employee engagement. Research limitations/implications - Employees' communication behaviors such as megaphoning and scouting have special strategic values to organizations. With information seeking, selecting, forwarding, and sharing behaviors of employees, organizations may obtain more valuable information than through formal procedures and channels. Professional literature has long been supporting the importance of fostering positive employee communication behaviors (ECBs), suggesting that WOM and information from the employees deemed as most trustworthy by the external publics. ECBs about their organizations may be viewed as a testament of the quality of EOR. This study results show that employee engagement plays a key role in creating positive ECBs. Practical implications - Pragmatically, as noted in the findings, symmetrical communication is an important factor that leads to positive ECB. To facilitate employees' favorable communication regarding an organization, therefore, the organization needs to practice a two-way, employee-centered symmetrical communication system in its everyday communication management. Communication managers are advised to nurture internal communication practices that listen to the employees and invite their participation in addition to providing complete and fair information to employees. Second, by showing the significant positive influence of EOR on employee engagement and ECB, the finding of the study suggests that strategic relationship management with internal publics affect overall management effectiveness. Hence, organizational managers need to adopt various relationship cultivation strategies in their communication with employees, which have been previously proposed by several studies. Originality/value - The findings of the study demonstrated that the effects of employee relationship management and symmetrical internal communication indeed exist beyond ECBs to the actual managerial outcomes. The findings also suggest a three-stage model of employee communication management: employee/internal communication management antecedents; employee engagement; and supportive outcomes of effective employee communication programs, such as supportive/extra ECBs.","[Kang, Minjeong] Indiana Univ, Dept Journalism, Bloomington, IN USA; [Sung, Minjung] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Seoul, South Korea",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Chung Ang University,"Sung, M (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Seoul, South Korea.",mjsung@cau.ac.kr,"Sung, Minjung/GSD-7836-2022","Kang, Minjeong/0000-0001-9988-283X",,,,,93,193,286,7,129,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1363-254X,1478-0852,,J COMMUN MANAG,J.

The purpose of the present investigation was to theorize the content of cancer blogs, a form of cybercoping, by examining valenced coping-relevant frames that bloggers use to describe their experiences with cancer. This research is both theoretically and methodologically innovative. Theoretically, we advance the concept of cyberframing by connecting the rather disconnected literatures on coping and framing and by studying this topic from a communication perspective. Methodologically, this is one of the few studies of coping with cancer that has used naturally occurring communication data to its advantage. A content analysis of cancer blog entries (N=194) indicated that more than 90% of cancer blog posts were embedded in a valenced frame. The frames were either negative, positive, or balanced; balanced frames varied in the intensity of the valence. The most common frames were positive and balanced with low affect.","[Donovan, Erin E.; Nelson, Erin C.; Scheinfeld, Emily] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Commun Studies, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Donovan, EE (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Commun Studies, Ctr Hlth Commun, 2405 Whitis Ave,A1105, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",edk@austin.utexas.edu,"Scheinfeld, Emily/AAW-7417-2020","Scheinfeld, Emily/0000-0001-6395-2672",,,,,61,9,11,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1041-0236,1532-7027,,HEALTH COMMUN,Health Commun.,JAN,2017,32,1,,,,,1,10,,10.1080/10410236.2015.1089467,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2015.1089467,,,10,Communication; Health Policy & Services,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Health Care Sciences & Services,EB0TM,27128696,,,,2024-08-19,WOS:000387058700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As part of the evaluation of a collaborative stormwater outreach and education campaign, a campus-wide survey, assisted by a large public university's public affairs office, was conducted to identify key predictors of public engagement in a watershed protection program. A path analysis for the proposed situation engagement model revealed that problem recognition was the key to predicting both information seeking and sharing. The path analysis also yielded a significant association between communication behaviors and public engagement, mediated by the use of organizational media in seeking information on the issue. Further, the analysis showed a significant direct effect of involvement on engagement.

J,"Kim, S; Kim, JN; Tam, L","Kim, Soojin; Kim, Jeong-Nam; Tam, Laishan",,,Think socially but act publicly: refocusing CSR as corporate public responsibility,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS,,,English,Article,,STAKEHOLDERS; CITIZENSHIP,"Current literature has identified many different definitions for the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR). As a result, many organizations fail to implement and measure CSR strategically. This study reviews the different theories and concepts within CSR and suggests that the current scope of CSR activities is too large that organizations are unable to find a tangible link between CSR and their bottom line. Using two case examples, this study proposes refocusing the concept of CSR as corporate public responsibility (CPR) based on which organizations utilize the concept of publics to prioritize the groups to which they must fulfill their responsibilities before attending to society as a whole.

The concept also addresses the limitations of existing theories. The practical implications of this concept will be discussed in detail.

The six dimensions were as follows: positive-proactive megaphoning, positive-reactive megaphoning, negative-proactive megaphoning, negative-reactive megaphoning, avoiding, and no-commenting. A series of surveys was conducted both in Korea (N = 500) and the United States (N = 500) for the development of the model.

First, we tested the validity of the original STOPS model with a sex crime issue in the context of Korea. Second, we tested the mediating role of negative emotions in the relationship between situational recognition and communicative action. The result suggests that STOPS is a useful model with a crime problem in the Korean context. Also, our proposed model shows that negative emotions serve as another aspect of motivation, and emotional experiences might precede subsequent cognitive activities. Especially, negative emotions show a stronger effect on situational motivation than communicative action. This study also found that negative emotions people feel about sex crimes directly influence their communicative action. Among different types of publics, the active and aware publics show stronger emotional responses than do the latent publics and nonpublics.","[Shin, Kyung-Ah] Natl Disaster Management Inst, Res Planning Div PR, Seoul, South Korea; [Han, Miejeong] Hanyang Univ, Coll Commun, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Han, M (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Coll Commun, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",mjhan909@hanyang.ac.kr,,"Han, Miejeong/0009-0004-3236-0163",,,,,49,28,30,3,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0129-2986,1742-0911,,ASIAN J COMMUN,Asian J.

This study examines a crisis caused by an organisation's appointed advertising agency whose actions led the organisation to be accused of interfering with press freedom. This study uses content analysis to analyse the news coverage on the crisis response strategies used and the tone of the coverage. It found that justification was the most frequently used strategy.

Design/methodology/approach - Applying the two theoretical frameworks (situational theory of publics and social exchange theory) to NIMBY, this study used a quantitative approach by using 471 participants in a 4 (publics: active, aware, aroused or inactive) x 2 (advocacy message type: supportive or opposing message) experimental design. Findings - The results showed that regardless of message types, active publics were more likely to participate in community activities than any other public, but this group strongly opposed the harmful facility, while inactive publics continued to be inactive. However, aware and aroused publics were significantly influenced by messages. Originality/value - The rationale and findings of this research are original, as they have not been published previously, and are not being simultaneously submitted elsewhere. This research should contribute to the broad body of knowledge and practices in community-based conflict issues in terms of risk management.

Specifically, it explores the differences between chronic activists and other types of publics who were affected by this chronic environmental issue. A total of 24 interviews were conducted, from which five different types of publics were identified. The findings suggest that the majority of activists who are currently working on the issue are closed-chronic activists, which are slightly different from Ni and Kim's findings on chronic activists' communicative behaviors. Interviews were also conducted with five communication experts to propose viable conflict resolution strategies for the issue. The mutual-gains approach is recommended as a viable organization-public conflict resolution strategy.

This article reviews the dominant literature that positions public relations in contrast to activism and suggests theoretical directions for bridging the gap between activism and public relations. This critical essay provides a brief historical outline of activism in public relations literature, identifying gaps and proposing the cultural-economic model (CEM; Curtin & Gaither, 2005) as a way to propel scholarship of activism and public relations forward.

The study also compares the associations between the factors and uploading intentions of two different cultures, the United States and South Korea. Using data from surveys of college students from the two countries (n=249 and 173), structural equation modeling analyses revealed that ego involvement not only plays an essential role in explaining uploading intention but also functions as an antecedent of attitude and perceived behavioral control in both countries. However, the subjective norm was not significantly associated with uploading intention in either country, and the descriptive norm was a marginally significant factor in accounting for uploading intention in the United States. Moreover, it was found that, only in the United States, attitude was significantly associated with uploading intention, whereas perceived behavioral control was a significant factor in explaining uploading intention in both countries. These findings suggest that the effects of cultural differences, the impact of subjective norms in particular, may be weakened with the more self-oriented nature of Web 2.0 applications and social media such as Wikipedia.

This paper adopts a public-oriented perspective to investigate citizens' voices and engagement within 10 Italian municipalities' Facebook Pages. In particular, it investigates the motivations to become Facebook fan of a municipality, and the variety of digital practices carried out by citizens to communicate and relate with this type of public administrations. The study was carried out through the administration of an online survey of 35 questions to 1196 Facebook users. The research proposes an active digital public typology (likers, mono interaction users, multi-interaction users, full interaction users) based on the extension of the activities that citizens carry out on municipalities' Facebook Pages. The thematic analysis of the digital publics' opinions reveals that citizens ask for a tangible and actual two-way communication with local administrations on social media.

Legislators were found to privilege expert colleagues and constituents over mass media as healthcare policy information sources; additionally, face-to-face encounters with constituents were preferred over e-mail, although respondents largely felt positive about using e-mail with both constituents and colleagues. These preferences regarding information sourcing and delivery indicate that public relations practitioners' (PRPs) continuing tendency to communicate with state legislators using traditional media-centric methods are problematic.

Requirements emerge from the social interaction and communication between the requirements practitioner and the various stakeholders. The main problems with the requirements engineering process are communication and coordination breakdowns, as well as the lack of domain knowledge or understanding of the problem. These challenges are all related to the social interaction during the requirements engineering process that impacts the quality of requirements. In practice, requirements are still produced with errors which then lead to unsuccessful solutions to problems. The ultimate goal of any practitioner is delivering a solution fit for purpose first time around. If the social patterns of practitioners that deliver quality requirements are known and compared with those that do not deliver quality requirements, individual performance can be adjusted. The results of this study confirmed that quality of requirements is dependent on the communication established between the requirements practitioner and relevant stakeholders. The communication is enabled through the trust relationships between the parties. A description of how practitioners behave during the requirements process is provided. By discovering these interaction patterns, communication can be improved and made more effective. Additionally, the relationships between the practitioners and their stakeholders are described. These trust patterns provide insight into the levels of collaboration, communication and sharing of knowledge between the practitioners and their stakeholders. By identifying these relationship patterns, the value each party receives from the relationships could increase, and the communication breakdowns could be minimised.","[Marnewick, A.; Pretorius, J.

These communicative actions sustain the competitive advantage of a company. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on interviews with internal communication experts; internal communication managers in ten American and 22 Italian companies. Three focus groups in Italy comprised of internal communication managers, scholars and experts. Findings - Employee communicative actions have been categorized into: exploration, interpretation, sharing and acting. Internal communication strategies enable employees to be effective communicators. Research limitations/implications - A survey among employees was used to investigate the link between employee communicative actions and internal communication and relationship quality. Practical implications - Internal communication managers are expected first, to become enablers towards employees and line managers; and second, to facilitate sense-making processes and the quality relationship building. Originality/value - This article provides empirical evidence of the emerging issues of employee communicative actions and the enablement function of internal communication. It adds a broader and validated range of employee communicative actions to those that had previously been studied, and develops a preliminary inventory of enablement strategies that have been adopted by leading companies.","[Mazzei, Alessandra] IULM Univ, Corp Commun, Milan, Italy",IULM International University Languages & Media,"Mazzei, A (corresponding author), IULM Univ, Corp Commun, Milan, Italy.",alessandra.mazzei@iulm.it,"Mazzei, Alessandra/I-4024-2014",,Ascai; Ferrero; Henkel Italia; Hogg Robinson Italia; IBM Italia; illycaffe; Iper; la grande i; Micron Technology; Natuzzi Group; Porsche Italia; Unicoop Firenze,Ascai; Ferrero; Henkel Italia; Hogg Robinson Italia; IBM Italia(International Business Machines (IBM)); illycaffe; Iper; la grande i; Micron Technology; Natuzzi Group; Porsche Italia(Volkswagen); Unicoop Firenze,"The research project, Internal communication for employee enablement, was carried out in 2011 by the Internal Communication Laboratory at IULM University in cooperation with the Baruch College/CUNY and supported by Ascai, Ferrero, Henkel Italia, Hogg Robinson Italia, IBM Italia, illycaffe, Iper, la grande i, Micron Technology, Natuzzi Group, Porsche Italia and Unicoop Firenze.",,42,40,63,1,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3289,1758-6046,,CORP COMMUN,Corp.

Analysis of results from an Internet/mail survey indicated statistically significant differences among respondents 'attitudes based on gender, ethnicity, and political party affiliation (ANOVA). Such differences, however, did not skew in expected directions based on popular wisdom and previous studies. While Hispanic, Native American and mixed-ethnicity legislators were more likely than non-Hispanic white legislators to agree that healthcare issues such as access and affordability should be state priorities, not left to the private sector, female legislators were more likely than their male counterparts to downplay the importance of such issues and to indicate they should not be the state's responsibility. Democratic Party legislators were more likely than Republican legislators both to see healthcare as an important priority and to relegate it to the the private sector. These attitudes and differences may be used to inform public relations practice with regard to influencing legislators' policymaking decisions, although future research should focus on the impact of intersectionality of gender, ethnicity, and party affiliation in mitigating effects of legislator characteristics on issue attitudes.","[White, Judith M.] Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"White, JM (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",,,,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Center for Healthcare Policy at the University of New Mexico,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Center for Healthcare Policy at the University of New Mexico,"The provision of funding for this study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Center for Healthcare Policy at the University of New Mexico is gratefully acknowledged.

Responding to the need for new approaches that consider global, cultural, and technological trends in consumer publics, this study provides evidence to a proposed intersectional approach to the segmentation of publics. Thirty-one women of different racial, socioeconomic, age, and relationship backgrounds were interviewed to explore how they perceived their multiple, overlapping identities influence their health decision making. Findings suggest that publics experience co-occurring oppression and privilege in varying contexts: in representations of them, in policies that affect them, and in structures that enable or hinder their ability to improve their health. The findings suggest that intersecting social structures shape disparate health public relations, intersecting policies widen the policymaker-public gap, and intersecting representations reflect a paradox of segmentation.","[Vardeman-Winter, Jennifer] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Jiang, Hua] Syracuse Univ, SI Newhouse Sch Publ Commun, Syracuse, NY USA; [Tindall, Natalie T.

Such segmentation may be most helpful in understanding members' participation patterns and explaining the benefits members gain from participation. This study aimed to explore whether members of online depression communities vary in their interests in issues discussed in the communities, and if so, whether groups with different interests also differ with regard to the benefits gained from participation. The study was based on an online survey of 793 members of 16 online depression communities. Results identified four member groups: concerned about daily living, information seekers, interested in all topics, and relatively less involved. There were very few differences between the groups in background characteristics, participation patterns, and level of depression. However, results indicated significant differences between the groups in perceived benefits, as the interested in all topics reported more online support and offline improvement than the information seekers and the relatively less involved, and more offline improvement than the concerned about daily living. Assuming that the reported interests reflected actual involvement in discussions of different issues, the findings suggest that combining supportive and informative discussions is more beneficial than attending to only one type of discussion, and stress the importance of informative discussions.","[Nimrod, Galit] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Commun Studies, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Nimrod, G (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Commun Studies, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",galit_n@zahav.net.il,"Nimrod, Galit/AAA-1392-2019","Nimrod, Galit/0000-0001-5878-8222",,,,,43,27,28,4,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1041-0236,1532-7027,,HEALTH COMMUN,Health Commun.,JUL 1,2013,28,5,,,,,425,434,,10.1080/10410236.2012.691068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2012.691068,,,10,Communication; Health Policy & Services,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Health Care Sciences & Services,187GE,22809441,,,,2024-08-19,WOS:000322104100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of a conceptual analysis and literature review. Findings - A multidisciplinary framework is provided to form the basis of further exploration of provider information behaviour. Research limitations/implications - There are various types of information providers and they provide opportunities for exploring and comparing their range of information activities and developing models of provider information behaviour. Originality/value - The paper argues for a new perspective to the study of information behaviour. The paucity of research on internal users of information has not matched those on external users of information over the years. An exploration of provider information behaviour together with its internal impact can provide insights which will help organisations better understand best practice, predict effects of new behaviours during periods of change and make informed decisions.

The purpose of this paper is to examine how attitudinal and behavioral outcomes are influenced by relational gap as the discrepancy between the expected relationships under deregulation and the experienced public relationships under monopolistic completion. Design/methodology/approach - With this purpose, an online survey was conducted with customers of a monopolistic utility provider; a sample of 1,145 adults living in the region was provided from an academic online panel database project for research participants, yielding a response rate of 32 percent. Findings - The key findings are that, among the four relational outcomes, control mutuality and satisfaction showed the biggest and significant shift to higher levels of performance expectations under competition than under a monopoly. Further, a shift in control mutuality and satisfaction led to more negative attitudes toward the company and a stronger intention to switch. Originality/value - This study can contribute to the practice and study of communication management by suggesting a sound empirical framework in managing public relationships.","[Kang, Minjeong] Ball State Univ, Dept Journalism, Muncie, IN 47306 USA",Ball State University,"Kang, M (corresponding author), Ball State Univ, Dept Journalism, Muncie, IN 47306 USA.",minpal2002@gmail.com,,"Kang, Minjeong/0000-0001-9988-283X",,,,,54,7,7,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1363-254X,1478-0852,,J COMMUN MANAG,J.

The article then suggests that although stakeholder theory and situational theory are useful tools for conceptualizing strategic publics in public diplomacy, these theories must be expanded to capture fully the complex nature of the contemporary diplomatic environment.

Using the Situational Theory of Problem Solving (STOPS), we segmented the general population into more meaningful subgroups (e.g., active, aware publics about an organ donation issue) and examined whether segmented public profiles could predict their likelihood of active information giving, taking, and selecting about donor shortage. We also tested whether those publics that are more active about the organ donation issue would recognize and be interested in other organ donation issues (e.g., shortage of bone marrow donors). Findings based on two survey data sets (N = 316 and N = 347) suggested that perceptual and motivation variables could predict the likelihood of information behaviors and further donation-related behavioral intentions. In addition, we found some evidence on the problem chain recognition effectif one becomes active about an organ donation issue, she or he is likely to perceive similar or related issues as problematic.
